 <p>Just after the completion of your new bike to let property, your first task 
 will be to make it ready for your tenants. Depending upon where the negotiated 
 to also purchase the furniture from the seller, you may need to furnish the 
 property. Many landlords choose to let out of property and furnished or partly 
 let. However younger and single tenants only have a minimal amount of furniture 
 and would expect beds, cabinets, tables, chairs and kitchen appliances to be 
 provided at a minimum. So think about who you are going to market your buy to 
 let property for. Providing a fully furnished rental property allows you to 
 charge slightly more on the rent. While it is empty a few days, it is an ideal 
 opportunity to decorate and plan the interior look and feel of the property. 
 Many properties that were previously residential dwellings, are likely to have 
 highly personal decorative of tastes (in terms of wall colours, carpets and 
 curtains). So now is the time to spruce up the interior with neutral colours 
 that can be applied throughout, particularly the kitchen and bathroom. 
 <p>If you are a first-time landlord, you should expect that any furniture you 
 do decide to purchase for your new rental property, will eventually suffer 
 wearing tear. Constant use by your tenants will inevitably cause accidental 
 chips, blocks, smears, breaks, spills and so on. Even if you choose to let the 
 property unfurnished, it is still sensible to provide the very basics, such as 
 a fridge/ freezer, cooker, washing machine, carpets and curtains. Otherwise 
 prospective tenants are likely to be the to be put off during letting agent 
 viewings, as many tenants don't want to incur the cost and hassle of buying 
 their own furniture ( particularly in its large and cumbersome and difficult to 
 transport in future).<p>If you market your property is a fully furnished 
 rental, your tenant can move in completely empty handed, and yet still have 
 everything they need to live in comfort and convenience. In practice, you will 
 probably need to think about what items of furniture your ideal tenant is 
 likely to expect, want and need. If you're going to kit out a whole house, you 
 should remember that there are usually lead times for kitchen and bathroom 
 deliveries. So you may need to start ordering the larger white goods and 
 kitchen units well before the completion date, in order to avoid any 
 unnecessary rental voids.<p>It doesn't take much time to decorate an empty 
 house. But remember you should never alienate one particular tenant market by 
 inflicting your own personal taste (regarding interior design and colour). Most tenants  expect quality decoration and furnishings 
 due to the wide choice of butter properties on the market. It can make an 
 enormous difference to the tenants property if they see it as being well 
 decorated and looked after. In general terms you should try and go for clean, neutral and simple colors throughout. 
 The most important rooms are the lounge, kitchen and bathroom. don't be afraid 
 to go for ordinary beige or magnolia. It will mean that when you come to 
 repaint house in a few years time, you can easily access the same colours from 
 your local DIY store.<p>You'll need to make sure that the general condition of 
 your new buy to let property is first class, before you start viewings for prospective tenants. 
 You will want to attract the most tidiest and the fussy tenants, when it comes 
 to keeping the house neat and tidy and clean. So make sure the property is 
 clean and tidy before the viewings. Cleanliness is essential; vacum and dust everywhere and tidy loose objects away. Make sure all light bulbs work, 
 as it can be embarrassing showing tenants around in the dark. First impressions 
 really do count so very little cost you could even put some fresh flowers out. 
 Empty properties collect dust quickly so it's a good idea to wash window frames down. 
 Chuck out any junk mail for tenants come for the viewing. Lastly make sure that 
 there is adequate security by providing window locks on every window, a strong bolt, burglar alarm and a security light. <p>
 Any building work you need to do, prior to tenants moving in, will inevitably 
 mean that the property will become empty for extended period of time. You'll 
 need to check with your
 <a href="http://www.let-a-property.info/buy-to-let-insurance.htm">buy to let 
 insurance</a> company, to understand if there are any warranties or conditions 
 placed upon you to check up on property at regular intervals. The biggest risk 
 is that a personal leaking pipe continues to cause water damage until such time 
 as someone visits the empty property to mend the leaking pipe. Most landlord 
 insurance companies will also want to know about any structural changes you 
 make to the building itself. You may need to get a revaluation of the buildings 
 sum insured if you are planning to do major works (such as a loft conversion).<p>
 Before you can even market your new buy to let property, you must first agree a 
 rental value with your letting agent. to make sure you are realistic in your 
 assumptions you should investigate the going rate for similar properties in the area, to the one you have purchased. 
 As part of the
 <a href="http://www.let-a-property.info/buying-investment-property.htm">
 property buying process</a> you should be tracking the rental values over a period of two months and make sure you are confident in the stability of the area. 
 The rent you will be able to charge is based largely upon the property location. 
 one of the biggest unexpected cost of servicing a buy to let mortgage, during 
 periods of rental voids. Don’t be a greedy landlord in setting your rent too high. It is usually better to have a 
 a more reasonable rent (with fewer rental void periods) than to suffer void periods.  <p>If you plan to use a letting agent to manage your property, try to use a letting agent that is a member of the Association of Residential Letting Agents (ARLA). You will need to 
 sign a landlord agreement with a letting agent. Alternatively, you may adopt to save around 15% of your monthly rent 
 managing the let yourself. It’s a simple balance of hassle/ time versus money. One of letting agents biggest strengths is that they have a steady stream of prospective tenants at their window or in their office. 
 They will have professional processes to vet and process these prospective tenants quickly. To advertise and vet prospective tenants yourself wastes time – which costs you money. <p>Before you 
 show a prospective tenant your property, think about your safety. Always tell someone exactly where you are going, the details of who you are meeting, what time you will be leaving and returning; and any contact telephone numbers. Be organised enough to know the approximate costs of Council Tax, Water, Sewage, Gas and Electricity, if the prospect 
 happens to ask. If a prospective tenant wants to let your new property right 
 away, ask for a non-refundable Holding Deposit (which will eventually be deducted from their initial rent) of say £100. Be prepared with a form for them to complete either on the spot or post back to you, requesting their personal details to initiate 
 the tenant referencing processes. <p>If references appear OK, and you are not using an agent, you should 
 collect the rental deposit yourself from the tenant (usually one and a half times monthly rent), plus one months rent in advance. 
 At the same time the Assured Shorthold Tenancy Agreement (AST) Is signed. It is important to 
 personalise your own AST to ensure it protects your interests. Any additional clauses must be fair under the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999. Make sure your tenancy agreement is sent away to the Stamp Office with your stamp duty so that it is legally valid.<p>It is essential that a detailed inventory process take place before the tenancy begins. An inventory is an accurate written description of your property and its contents, providing evidence in the event of a future dispute regarding the property and/or its contents. An inventory will protect you and the tenant from disputes, as it is a document you both sign up and agree to, before the tenancy begins. <p>
 When you finally hand over the keys make sure you have one set, the agent has 
 one set (if you are using an agent) and the tenants have two sets (including 
 any other keys for the windows, padlocks, alarm, garages etc). Personal touches 
 and first impressions really do count… If you cannot personally Welcome Your 
 Tenant to their new home, leave a note or card; detail utility companies 
 telephone numbers as well as local information on restaurants, take-away, bus 
 and train timetables, maps, local emergency telephone numbers etc.</div><p> </td><td valign=top> <div class=rightborder> <table border=1 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 style="border-style:solid; border-color:#FFFFFF; border-collapse: collapse; " bordercolor="#111111" bordercolorlight="#FFFFFF" bordercolordark="#FFFFFF" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><tr> <td style="border-style: none; border-width: medium" valign=top> <script type="text/javascript"><!--
