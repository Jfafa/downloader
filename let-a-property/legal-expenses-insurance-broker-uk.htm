 <p>Most landlords tend to focus on the financial aspects of property letting. 
 Who could fail to get excited about the opportunity of substantial capital 
 growth involved in property investment and letting, or the thought of stable 
 and long term income streams from rental payments. Yet for all of the planning 
 that goes into the purchasing and managing of a buy to let property, it's easy 
 to overlook some of the potential risks of becoming a landlord. Some of these 
 risks could have severe financial implications, and even jeopardise the entire 
 long-term return on investment. However landlords can feel a bit more 
 comfortable regarding their future, if they have taken out a comprehensive Legal Expenses Insurance 
 policy. This type of policy aims to pay for the financial cost associated with 
 some of the risks of property letting. </p>
 <p>Legal expenses policy is normally sold as an additional add-on to the main 
 buildings and contents policy. It can be easily overlooked by landlords, who 
 are generally in a hurry to complete their buy to let mortgages, and save as 
 much money as they can in the
 <a href="http://www.let-a-property.info/buying-investment-property.htm">
 property buying process</a>. However if you are serious about managing your investments, then purchasing this product can provide you with a great deal of peace of mind, 
 and for a relatively small premium.<br> <br> Over recent years rights of 
 tenants have been justifiably enhanced through statutory legislation. As a 
 result, if a tenants refuse to leave a rented property or pay their rent, then 
 landlords must go through what ever legal process to recover any monies and/or 
 evict their tenants. The whole process can take up a lot of the landlords time, 
 and become very expensive in terms of legal costs. A good Legal Expenses 
 Insurance policy can go a long way to helping to deal with problems as and when they arise. 
 Each legal expenses policy will be slightly different from the next, between 
 insurance companies. So you should always check the policy wording and Key 
 Facts document to understand the key differences, and how they apply to your 
 individual insurance needs and requirements. In particular you should check any 
 policy exclusions, what the policy actually covers, any warranties which may 
 invalidate the policy if not enforced, as well as any excess levels, before an 
 insurance claim can be made against the policy.</p>
 <p>In general terms legal expenses insurance policies tend to comprise the 
 following features. Firstly defence against prosecution cover relates to 
 situations where the landlord may potentially be in breach of statutory 
 regulations. These may include breaches of the Gas Safety Regulations, 
 Furniture &amp; Furnishings and Electrical Equipment safety Regulations. Your top 
 priority should be to health and safety of your tenants. To this end these 
 regulations compel you to take steps to ensure that the risk fire at gas, do 
 not endanger the health and safety of tenants in anyway. A more common 
 scenario, are situations in which, as a landlord you have no choice but to 
 evict your tenant from the property, (probably due to a serious breach of the 
 assured short hold tenancy agreement). To implement an eviction you will need a 
 solicitor, whose job it would be to advise you on obligatory steps you must 
 follow in order to make any eviction lawful. In this situation your solicitors' 
 charges would be paid for by the legal expenses policy. </p>
 <p>Most legal expenses insurance policies provide 24-hour helpline, in order to 
 gain some initial advice from a solicitor over the telephone. This can be an 
 invaluable service in discussing the situation and getting a general indication 
 of the likely next steps. They can provide an initial assessment as to whether 
 your circumstances are likely to lead to some type of court proceedings in the 
 future. As a landlord you have to be extremely careful that you do not take any 
 unlawful or and reasonable steps prior to any court proceedings, which may 
 invalidate any future claim on the policy. This may include such things as 
 issuing legal correspondence yourself, directly to your tenant without first 
 taking legal advice beforehand.</p> <p>A Legal Expenses Policy also becomes 
 invaluable in situations where you are forced to chase tenants for rent 
 arrears. As more and more tenants struggle to keep their head above water, 
 there has been a general increase in the numbers of tenants failing to keep up 
 with their rent. If the tenant were to leave the property and failed to make 
 payments due to the landlord, policy may assist the landlord in recovery of 
 those monies. The use of a solicitor to facilitate recovery of unpaid rent from 
 the Tenant, will be paid for via a claim against the policy. As each policy 
 differs slightly, don't forget to check to ensure the policy provides as much 
 protection as possible for your insurance needs.<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</div><p> </td><td valign=top> <div class=rightborder> <table border=1 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 style="border-style:solid; border-color:#FFFFFF; border-collapse: collapse; " bordercolor="#111111" bordercolorlight="#FFFFFF" bordercolordark="#FFFFFF" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><tr> <td style="border-style: none; border-width: medium" valign=top> <script type="text/javascript"><!--
