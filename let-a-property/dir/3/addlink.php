      <font size="2" face="Verdana">Letting agents or leasing agents (as 
      they are known in America) provides a range of useful services to assist 
      tenants find their accommodation. The role of a letting agent is 
      essentially to manage a Rental Property on behalf of a landlord or 
      property management company. Their tasks include the initial advertising 
      of the property within a branch office and or on their website. The rental 
      agent usually has authority to negotiate and to take holding deposit 
      monies and rental deposit from prospective tenants. Typically, letting 
      agents will have many viewings&nbsp; to undertake on a daily basis in many busy 
      urban areas. They will also be responsible for initiating a credit check 
      of the tenants and possibly providing registration inventory check in 
      services. They also act to assist what the tenants in day to day problems 
      such as dealing with repairs caused by a leaking pipe or broken fence.

      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Some rental property agents have 
      relationships with property maintenance companies in the local area they 
      serve. . Letting agents provide a useful service for landlords who do not 
      wish the day today hassle of dealing with Tennant telephone enquiries and 
      the initial prospect find of the tenant in the first place. Most letting 
      agents have their own websites (as this is the primary source of first 
      contact for most prospective tenants seeking accommodation). </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Another key responsibility of the 
      letting agent is the collection of rent and facilitating the signing&nbsp; of 
      the assured short hold tenancy agreement. In the United Kingdom, most lets 
      are for a period of or six months and can be extended depending upon the 
      needs and wants of both the landlord and the tenant. Finding short term 
      accommodation like a bed and breakfast or a guesthouse can easily be 
      achieved through the many online property portals and directories of local 
      services. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The recent credit crunch  has 
      meant that there has been a rise in the demand for Rental Property. This 
      is due to the nervousness of many first time buyers who are choosing to 
      rent and see what happens in the property market place. </font></p>
