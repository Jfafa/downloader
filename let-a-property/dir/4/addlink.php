    <td style="border-style: none; border-width: medium" valign="top" align="justify">      <p>&nbsp;<p><font color="#808080">We do not provide financial advice.&nbsp; Therefore, if you are a UK 
      based potential home buyer, we hope you find the following short overview 
      useful as part of the process of contacting a qualified independent 
      financial advisor. A mortgage is a contract with a lender that puts up 
      your property as security against a loan. You cannot sell the property 
      without the loan being paid off. If you fail to meet mortgage payments the 
      mortgage lender has the right to repossess the property. The longer the 
      mortgage period the smaller the monthly payments (however the overall cost 
      is higher due to larger total interest repaid). </font>

        <p>&nbsp;<p><font color="#808080">Getting a home loan or mortgage can be
      complicated and time consuming exercise. The first step is to obtain
      qualified financial independent advice form a qualified IFA. IFA&'s are
      invaluable in working with a select band of mortgage companies and
      speeding through mortgage applications. They are best placed to advise on
      all mortgage products currently available in the marketplace. An IFA is
      constrained by legal obligations to investigate your financial needs in
      order to recommend financial products. They will have access to
      potentially thousands of mortgages products and can contact lenders
      directly there are many to choose from. Tied Agents are paid by life,
      pensions or insurance companies to sell you their products. As a result
      they are not legally allowed to discuss other products on the market. They
      are usually found based amongst estate agents. </font>

        <p> <font color="#808080"> <br>
      <br>
      Next, calculate how much money you can actually borrow. Mortgage lenders
      will look at your deposit size and how much you earn. The smaller your
      deposit, the more your mortgage lender may charge you (supposedly for
      extra risk). The credit crunch of 2008 has changed the attitudes of
      lenders who previously promoted up to 6 times an applicant income.
      Mortgage lenders use simple a income multiple formulae; the general market
      calculation for single applicants is three times your annual income
      (excluding sales commissions). How much money you can borrow is also
      dependant on the mortgage products on the market; Lenders will dictate in
      their product range how much of the total value of the property they are
      prepared to lend you&nbsp; this is known as the Loan to value (LTV). This is
      the % of the property value the lender is prepared to lend you; the
      balance being made up of your deposit from cash. </font>

        <p> <font color="#808080"> <br>
      <br>
      Next you have to choose the type of Mortgage best suits your needs.
      Standard Variable Rate (SVR) Mortgages link their variable interest to the
      Bank of England&'s published rate. Recently however, the inter banking rate
      (LIBOR) has gone up (even thought eh Bank of England's rate has come
      down). This demonstrates that lenders attitude towards market risk really
      dictates the variable rate borrowers can achieve. With fixed rate
      mortgages, the interest is set over a period of time, providing guaranteed
      knowledge to budget if interest rates unexpectedly rose. A Discounted
      Mortgage offers a headline grabbing deal (particularly for remortgages or
      first time buyers). A Capped Mortgage product is one where an upper limit
      is set against the variable rate. Within each mortgage the repayment may
      have two elements; capital and interest... </font>

        <p> <font color="#808080"> <br>
      <br>
      With a Repayment Mortgage (Capital &amp; Interest) part of your monthly
      payment goes toward paying off the capital and part of the payment is
      interest on the capital. Every year the outstanding capital balance
      reduces, but not the repayments. With an Interest Only Mortgage, the
      payments to the lender are made up of interest. None of the capital of the
      mortgage is paid off until the mortgage term has completed. </font>

        <p> <font color="#808080"> <br>
      <br>
      Once you have applied for your mortgage, the Lender will undertake Credit
      Reference Checks. This may include copies of accounts for self certified
      applicants and or a phone call with an independent accountant. Employees
      may have to produce years of bank statements, pay slips, P60 and utility
      bills.
      Next the lender undertakes a Property Valuation to assess the potential
      re-building cost of the property. Lastly, final mortgage approval is
      provided and monies released on the day of completion (subject to
      satisfactory building insurance confirmation) from the day of completion).
      The entire process can take from four weeks to three months on average.
