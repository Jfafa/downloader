      the left hand side of this page you will find details of links to Mortgage 
      Brokers, Finance portals and Home Loan brokers and lenders from the UK and 
      beyond....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>We do not provide financial advice.&nbsp; 
      Therefore, if you are a UK based potential home buyer, we hope you find 
      the following short overview useful as part of the process of contacting a 
      qualified independent financial advisor. A mortgage is a contract with a 
      lender that puts up your property as security against a loan. You cannot 
      sell the property without the loan being paid off. If you fail to meet 
      mortgage payments the mortgage lender has the right to repossess the 
      property. The longer the mortgage period the smaller the monthly payments 
      (however the overall cost is higher due to larger total interest repaid). 
      The different mortgage types available including the following:-</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>1. Repayment mortgage<br>
        2. Endowment Mortgage<br>
        3. Pension Mortgage<br>
        4. Interest Only mortgage<br>
        5. Buy to let Mortgage<br>
        6. Foreign Currency mortgage <br>
        7. Capped Mortgage<br>
        8. Fixed rate mortgage.<br>
        9. Tracker Mortgage</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Getting a home loan or mortgage can be 
      complicated and time consuming exercise. The first step is to obtain 
      qualified financial independent advice form a qualified IFA. IFA&'s are 
      invaluable in working with a select band of mortgage companies and 
      speeding through mortgage applications. They are best placed to advise on 
      all mortgage products currently available in the marketplace. An IFA is 
      constrained by legal obligations to investigate your financial needs in 
      order to recommend financial products. They will have access to 
      potentially thousands of mortgages products and can contact lenders 
      directly &#65533; there are many to choose from. Tied Agents are paid by life, 
      pensions or insurance companies to sell you their products. As a result 
      they are not legally allowed to discuss other products on the market. They 
      are usually found based amongst estate agents. <br>
      <br>
      Next, calculate how much money you can actually borrow. Mortgage lenders 
      will look at your deposit size and how much you earn. The smaller your 
      deposit, the more your mortgage lender may charge you (supposedly for 
      extra risk). The credit crunch of 2008 has changed the attitudes of 
      lenders who previously promoted up to 6 times an applicant income. 
      Mortgage lenders use simple a income multiple formulae; the general market 
      calculation for single applicants is three times your annual income 
      (excluding sales commissions). How much money you can borrow is also 
      dependant on the mortgage products on the market; Lenders will dictate in 
      their product range how much of the total value of the property they are 
      prepared to lend you &#65533; this is known as the Loan to value (LTV). This is 
      the % of the property value the lender is prepared to lend you; the 
      balance being made up of your deposit from cash. <br>
      <br>
      Next you have to choose the type of Mortgage best suits your needs. 
      Standard Variable Rate (SVR) Mortgages link their variable interest to the 
      Bank of England&'s published rate. Recently however, the inter banking rate 
      (LIBOR) has gone up (even thought eh Bank of England's rate has come 
      down). This demonstrates that lenders attitude towards market risk really 
      dictates the variable rate borrowers can achieve. With fixed rate 
      mortgages, the interest is set over a period of time, providing guaranteed 
      knowledge to budget if interest rates unexpectedly rose. A Discounted 
      Mortgage offers a headline grabbing deal (particularly for remortgages or 
      first time buyers). A Capped Mortgage product is one where an upper limit 
      is set against the variable rate. Within each mortgage the repayment may 
      have two elements; capital and interest... <br>
      <br>
      With a Repayment Mortgage (Capital &amp; Interest) part of your monthly 
      payment goes toward paying off the capital and part of the payment is 
      interest on the capital. Every year the outstanding capital balance 
      reduces, but not the repayments. With an Interest Only Mortgage, the 
      payments to the lender are made up of interest. None of the capital of the 
      mortgage is paid off until the mortgage term has completed. <br>
      <br>
      Once you have applied for your mortgage, the Lender will undertake Credit 
      Reference Checks. This may include copies of accounts for self certified 
      applicants and or a phone call with an independent accountant. Employees 
      may have to produce years of bank statements, pay slips, P60 and utility 
      bills.
      Next the lender undertakes a Property Valuation to assess the potential 
      re-building cost of the property. Lastly, final mortgage approval is 
      provided and monies released on the day of completion (subject to 
      satisfactory building insurance confirmation) from the day of completion). 
      The entire process can take from four weeks to three months on average.</p>
