      <p>&nbsp;<p><font color="#808080">Millions of people across
      the world you have enjoyed a growth in their incomes and standard of
      living, have subsequently purchased a second home or a holiday home
      (either to visit to enjoy themselves or as an investment). There are
      literally thousands of property websites on the Internet advertising
      holiday homes to buy or to rent. These make it easy for potential of
      homeowners to buy the property direct from the seller or quickly contact
      the sales agent to arrange a viewing or discuss the particulars. The local
      agents will have a good knowledge of local issues such as traffic
      conditions, future of local building developments that may impact the
      profitability of the holiday home let, as well as a feel for rental
      values, resale prices and the market conditions and trends. </font> 
      
      <p>&nbsp;<p><font color="#808080">Buying a holiday home
      abroad by a daunting task if you are ignorant of the laws and regulations
      of that country. News headlines highlighting the issues of the land grab
      in mainland Spain and general legal arguments regarding ownership of
      property following an inheritance, have provided pause for thought for UK
      investors and would be holiday homeowners. The first step is to visit the
      potential area and meet a number of independent estate agents and find a
      good local lawyer who can explain the legal process from start to finish.
      Identify the area you plan to visit based on your market research. Is
      there a new low cost airline about to base itself in a particular local
      Airport near to the area you are considering? Is it a popular holiday
      hotspot already and therefore saturated with empty holiday homes? What is
      the general economic market trend for that country? How much money can you
      afford to spend on the investment based on a potential UK remortgage
      situation or an ordinary overseas mortgage? These are all basic questions
      to be answered before you even make for your investigative holiday trip.

      effectively handle day to day maintenance issues remotely? or is it more
      cost effective (in terms of your personal time) to employ a local agent
      near to the property. The hassle of taking bookings and dealing with
      cancellations and Tennant enquiries can be time consuming. To minimise on
      the cost and hassle for maintaining a holiday let it is sensible to
