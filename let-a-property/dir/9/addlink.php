      <p><font size="2">The insurance industry both in the 
      United Kingdom and abroad is typically a very mature and highly regulated 
      sector of western economies. Insurance is the transfer or a risk from the 
      policyholder (who pays a lender an annual sum known as the premium) in 
      return for the transfer is risk to the lender (risk and terms are 
      qualified in the form of an insurance policy). In the event something 
      happens to the policy holders person or property that has been insured, 
      the policy holder can claim from the insurance company usually for a 
      financial sum usually equal to that of the loss incurred. Most insurance 
      companies provide strict conditions as to the nature of insurance claims 
      to prevent insurance fraud and to exclude of certain acts, (deemed not 
      insurable such as acts of god). In most countries insurance for property 
      is a condition of a mortgage being approved in the first place. It is also 
      common sense to protect the most valuable assets you own such as your 
      home, your car and of course your life. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2">In the UK there are literally hundreds 
      of types of insurance to buy you peace of mind and protect both 
      individuals and businesses. These sectors include Property and Home 
      Insurance, Travel insurance, Commercial insurance, Life and Health 
      Insurance, income protection and niche commercial insurance for specialist 
      business activities. The industry is highly regulated and also very 
      competitive due to the huge increase in the use of the Internet to obtain 
      new business and provide comparative price tools via insurance portals. 
      The industry is made up of insurance companies, middleman intermediaries, 
      insurance brokers, appointed representative and introducers. The use of 
      the Internet to sell insurance policies is growing rapidly as most large 
      lenders now sell directly to the general public via their websites as well 
      as using the intermediary market. The ability to sell policies direct 
      online without the use of a call centre or a middleman has reduced the 
      cost of sale or for most lenders. For this is particularly true for Home 
      Insurance and car insurance and travel insurance where the simplistic 
      nature of policies makes it easier for users to answer multiple choice 
      questions online in order to generate a quotation, which can then be 
      easily processed using a credit card.&nbsp; The policy holder policy 
      documentation can be downloaded by the policyholder and the whole process 
      can be achieve in minutes form anywhere in the world in the middle of the 
      night.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">In the United Kingdom, the market for 
      insurance is also underwritten by Lloyd's of London which is based on a 
      grouping or syndicate system that has been established in London for over 
      300 years. It dates back to maritime protection between merchants and gave 
      birth to the insurance industry in the coffee houses of London. Most 
      brokers have been pre-approved by either a placing broker (or a syndicate 
      based in Lloyd's of London), to sell a particular policy. They will 
      normally receive a commission and may or may not have the regulatory 
      approval to hold clients' money. The book of business may build up to a 
      point where the insurance broker receives a profit share from the lender 
      (or underwriter) based on the profitability of the book of business. 
      Therefore, the number of claims and their value is directly impacting 
      brokers future potential earnings and steers their behaviour towards 
      attempting to only ensure good quality risks that are less likely to have 
      produce a future insurance claims. This page does not constitute advice 
      and should be viewed as general information only.&nbsp; We strongly recommend 
      you contact your local insurance broker for professional advice.</font></p>
