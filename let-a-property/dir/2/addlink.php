      Property Agents </font></b>
      <p><b><font color="#ffffff" size="2">On the left of this page you will 
      find details of links to Property Agent Companies, such as estate agents, 
      letting agents and commercial property agents, from the UK and beyond...</font></b></p>
      <p><font color="#ffffff" size="2">In the United Kingdom, property agents 
      are known as estate agents, whereas in the USA they are known as realtors. 
      In European countries like France and Spain, and they're known as 
      Notaries. Despite what property agents are known as and where they are 
      located, the role of a property agent is similar in principle. Estate 
      agents act on behalf of a seller to help sell a property. Most estate 
      agents in the United Kingdom belong to a professional association or body 
      which establishes a code of conduct and sets out what what of Sellers can 
      expect what what from their agent. It helps provide a framework of 
      regulatory guidelines and documentation to help buyers buy and sellers 
      sell.&nbsp; The estate agent will prepare the 'particulars' of the property 
      when advertising it. Traditionally most estate agents have a high street 
      branch with a shop front window to advertise pictures and particulars of 
      properties for sale. During the last 20 years the Internet has become the 
      dominant medium to assist agents in gaining the initial contact from 
      prospective Buyers. The convenience and speed of the Internet means that 
      property advertisements can be displayed on portals such as Let-a-property.info 
      in minutes. There are literally thousands of property agent websites to 
      choose.&nbsp; User's prefer to browser for homes online in the privacy and 
      comfort of their hoe or workplace, before they get in their car and visit 
      the property to buy or sell.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#ffffff" size="2">Property agents main role is to 
      advertise the property in local newspapers and on the Internet, to find a 
      suitable vendors and qualify their needs and wants in terms of 
      affordability. Agents typically also liaise with both the Buyer's and 
      Vendor's solicitor or legal representative. Agents may also come into 
      contact with surveyors of representatives of a mortgage company to ensure 
      mortgage finance has been arranged and mortgage valuations and or 
      structural surveys are completed on time. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#ffffff" size="2">Buying the property is the single 
      largest purchase most people will ever make and as such they will normally 
      require some form of mortgage or loan to fund the purchase. In some 
      property agents branch offices, agents may allow an independent financial 
      adviser or a mortgage broker to offer to either 'tied' or independent 
      advice regarding mortgage products. The property agent would normally have 
      receive an introductory commission in exchange for passing the contact 
      details of the prospective home buyers on.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#ffffff" size="2">The property market in many western 
      economies has boomed between 1990 and 2006. There have been isolated local 
      falls in some countries such as Spain (where oversupply has forced a huge 
      amount of empty property on to the market). However, in most western 
      countries, speculation of and an increased demand for accommodation 
      (driven by increasing and migrating population what and changing social 
      factors), has forced prices upwards. In addition, the cost of borrowing 
      has decreased while the range of competing Financial Products to buy a 
      property has increased. The credit crunch of 2008, (which was associated 
      with banks and mortgage lenders exposure to wholesale bad debt form sub 
      prime USA lending) has severely dented confidence in property markets 
      worldwide. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#ffffff">The credit crunch </font>
      <font color="#ffffff" size="2">has had a local negative effects on 
      property agents, with cuts in staff in estate agent networks with multiple 
      branches or a large advertising commitment. In the building sector in 
      particular, new house builders have been particularly affected by the drop 
      in first time buyers and reduction in the number of new mortgage 
      approvals. However, in the very long term, the underlying macro economic 
      and socio economic problems of increased population growth and increased 
      cross border population migration are forecasted to continue, forcing 
      property prices slowly upwards in the long term.</font></p>
