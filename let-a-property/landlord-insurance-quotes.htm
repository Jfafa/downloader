 <p>In the United Kingdom, buy to let insurance is used to describe a form of
 <a href="http://www.let-a-property.info/building-insurance-uk.htm">building 
 insurance</a> which provides cover for landlords, who have purchased rental 
 property for letting purposes. This type of insurance generally falls into 
 either residential or commercial buildings categories. 
 <p>The most popular type of policy is for residential buy to let landlords, who 
 have acquired an investment property using a buy to let mortgage. Prior to any 
 buy to let mortgage being approved, the lender will require that suitable 
 building insurance is procured by the landlord, prior to any monies being 
 released. When a landlord shops around for cheap
 <a href="http://www.let-a-property.info/buy-to-let-insurance.htm">buy to let 
 insurance</a> quote, they should check whether or not the policy wording 
 satisfies the Council of Mortgage Lenders handbook. This document specifies a 
 broad range of perils that a building must be insured against to protect the 
 lenders interest. Lenders will insist on receiving a copy of the policy 
 document, prior to releasing any monies upon completion. <p> The cost of a 
 typical building insurance premium, is primarily dictated by the buildings 
 construction, age, as well as the postcode. However with residential buy to let 
 insurance policy, one of the additional main factors is type of tenant. Most 
 insurance companies prefer tenants to be working professionals, as opposed to 
 DSS tenants. Many housing associations will find DSS tenants accommodation in 
 the private landlord sector. Many landlords are happy to facilitate such 
 arrangements, due to the relative stability of receiving rental income from the 
 Council Authority. However buy to let insurance companies tend not to offer 
 such competitive landlord insurance rates for this scenario, as the landlord 
 has no control over who is occupying his building, unless the tenancy agreement 
 remains between the landlord and the tenant.<p> If you are a first-time 
 landlord, shopping around for suitable buy to let insurance policy, you will 
 find a range of additional optional extras exist. These are designed to provide 
 additional levels of protection, should unforeseen circumstances occur. Some of 
 these circumstances have grave financial outcomes. <p> Firstly many insurers 
 will offer landlords emergency assistance cover. This product is designed for 
 the many amateur landlords who have chosen to avoid the costs of using a 
 letting agent for day to day management, (and instead manage the rental 
 themselves). Landlords emergency assistance option can be useful to cover 
 domestic emergencies in the rental property (such as bust pipe, broken boiler 
 or a blocked rain). It takes the stress, time and hassle out of finding and 
 paying emergency repairmen, during unexpected or unsociable hours. The landlord 
 simply phones their insurance companies' helpline, describes the nature of the 
 emergency, an insurance company will organise a repair person to go out to the 
 rental property to fix the problem.<p>Secondly many landlords choose to take 
 out
 <a href="http://www.let-a-property.info/legal-expenses-insurance-broker-uk.htm">legal expenses insurance</a> cover, as an additional cover on top of their main 
 building insurance policy. This is a relatively cheap way to eliminate the 
 financial impact of the risk occurring as legal costs would be covered. The use 
 of legal process should be a last resort but if that worst case did arise, this 
 insurance covers the potentially large cost of using a solicitor. This type of 
 policy is becoming more popular because the United Kingdom is becoming more 
 litigious. It is becoming easier for a tenant to sue a landlord. Likewise the 
 policy can also be used to assist in the possible eviction proceedings of a 
 tenant, should they fail comply with the the terms of their tenancy agreement. Another common fear (and genuine risk) is 
 malicious damage from tenants. The financial impact of actually solving the 
 problem of non-paying tenants or squatters, is the cost of employing legal 
 professionals. So legal expenses is an optional insurance but very worthwhile. 
 Most policies with have different wordings, so its worth checking each one to 
 understand what is included or excluded.
 </p>
 <p>Lastly many landlords choose to adopt rent guarantee insurance in order  pay their rent, 
 in case the tenant doesn't pay the rent. There is 
 usually a policy excess before any payments will be made to the landlord. The 
 premium is normally calculated on the actual rent received. Beware that there 
 are usually caveats and limiting conditions attached to these generic policies. 
 This is for the conservative investor. Typically if you use a letting agent, 
 part of their service package might include guaranteeing three months rental 
 income in the event of them not being able to find paying tenants. In practice, 
 an agent should normally be able to find new tenants very quickly (within 3 
 months) anyway. Make sure this insurance is paid for, and set up before the 
 tenants enter the property, otherwise it may not become valid in the event of 
 an insurance claim.</p></div><p> </td><td valign=top> <div class=rightborder> <table border=1 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 style="border-style:solid; border-color:#FFFFFF; border-collapse: collapse; " bordercolor="#111111" bordercolorlight="#FFFFFF" bordercolordark="#FFFFFF" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><tr> <td style="border-style: none; border-width: medium" valign=top> <script type="text/javascript"><!--
