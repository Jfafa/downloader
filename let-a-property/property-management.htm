 <p>As a landlord there are many practical and legal aspects of managing a 
 rental property. Under the Housing Act 1996, and the Landlord and Tenant Act 
 1985, landlords have various legal obligations that they do need to make 
 themselves aware of. Similarly tenants also have implied obligations, including 
 paying bills, not to cause damages, paying rent and seeking permissions in 
 certain circumstances. Most of these details are normally detailed inside the 
 Assured Shorthold Tenancy Agreement. It is always sensible to use a qualified 
 solicitor to draft your tenancy agreement to make sure that any recent changes 
 in legislation are reflected in the agreement signed between you and your 
 tenant. Likewise the law grants tenants certain rights, granted by statute, 
 including the right of 'quiet enjoyment'. Make a note to seek some legal advice 
 regarding the things you absolutely must do, in order to comply with the letter 
 of the law the process of managing your rental property.<p>If you're planning 
 to manage the let yourself, (as opposed to using a letting agent), there are 
 quite a few practical activities that you will need to undertake. Firstly, to simplify property management administration, 
 it's a good idea to collect the rent on the same day each month. This is 
 normally the start date of the tenancy. Add a clause to your Assured Shorthold Tenancy agreement detailing how any potential future 
 increases in rent are to be determined. This must be done in accordance with 
 any statutory restrictions. <p>Secondly, if you are not used to dealing with 
 tenants, then it might be wiser to use a letting agent to do the property 
 management on your behalf. Effective communication is so critical. Treat your 
 tenants fairly and with consideration but do not get personally friendly with 
 them (even if you like them). If you set their expectations fairly at all 
 times, avoiding confusion (whether it be personally, on the phone or via a 
 letter), your tenancy should run smoothly.<p>Thirdly, it is a fact of life that 
 boilers break, roofs leak, washing machines stop working and so on. These types 
 of unforeseen management repairs also include painting and decorating, 
 treatment of wooden furniture for damp, replacing leaking pipes etc. If you are 
 using a letting agent, they will usually have pre-agreed management 
 responsibility to fix minor problems. If you are not using an agent you must be 
 prepared to accept phone calls at any time and be responsible enough to sort 
 out angry tenants. You cannot undertake major works or major improvements on 
 your property (like converting the loft) without consulting and getting the 
 permission of your tenant first. The tenant has right of “quiet enjoyment”.<p>Fourthly, you must make sure all property gas pipe work (valves, pipes, regulators and meters) and installed appliances (cookers, hobs, boilers, water heaters, fires, wall heaters, gas fridges, flues, central heating systems, fires etc) are checked, maintained annually 
 by a Engineer and hence safe. <p>Fifth, make sure your property tenancy 
 agreement includes a clause about the requirement to do half yearly inspections 
 to ensure the property is being well looked after. This will also allow you to 
 see if any repairs need undertaking that the tenant may not have informed you 
 about (or they have overlooked the need to do a repair).<p>Six, you mist submit annual accounts to the Inland Revenue, showing any profit or loss and hence tax payable as a result of your investment; Seven, regular expenses and rental income should ideally be managed using a 
 separate business bank account. Having a separate account will simplify accountancy matters and allow you to understand your cash flow position; Lastly, if you are managing the let yourself (property management), there is an inevitable level of hassle and 
 administration to deal with and pay for. <p>In order to ensure the smooth inventory 
 check out process for both yourself and the tenants, a simple documented process should be pre-agreed by both parties. It helps sets the expectations of your tenant(s) 
 if you send a letter a few weeks beforehand explaining the process, reminding 
 them that any small items that may have been broken must be replaced and 
 outlining the process for the return of their deposit. Remember to advertise 
 the property for re-letting, a couple of weeks before the checkout date to 
 eliminate void periods for getting new tenants in.</div><p> </td><td valign=top> <div class=rightborder> <table border=1 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 style="border-style:solid; border-color:#FFFFFF; border-collapse: collapse; " bordercolor="#111111" bordercolorlight="#FFFFFF" bordercolordark="#FFFFFF" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><tr> <td style="border-style: none; border-width: medium" valign=top> <script type="text/javascript"><!--
