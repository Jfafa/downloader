		<description>I like quite close to where that photo was taken!
Apparently some (quite a few) decades ago the river had a lot more water flowing through and it even had a beach where people would come and bathe in the summers but due to pollution and such it had to be closed down.</description>

		<description>I was recently cycling past the river, near the M30 and Casa de Campo boundary, and saw a guy fishing.   I was suprised when he caught a very large fish.   I would not like to eat it, but hte fish seemed fat and healthy ... and so did the fisherman.

Cleaning up rivers world-wide is a priority.

		<description>Un embajador alemán comentó que el Manzanares tenía la ventaja de ser &quot;navegable en coche y a caballo&quot;. Otra persona propuso que en verano se regase el río para que no levantara polvo.
Después de construido el Puente de Segovia las burlas continuaron. Lope de Vega propuso que se comprase un río o que se vendiese el puente. Góngora volvió a burlarse: “Duélete de esa puente, Manzanares, / mira que por ahí dice la gente / que no eres río para media puente / y que ella es puente para treinta mares”. Como curiosidad, en aquella época la palabra puente era femenina y se decía &quot;la puente&quot; igual que hoy decimos &quot;la fuente&quot;.</description>

		<description>If you try to go on a Friday or a day with less-than-perfect weather (or the month of June?), I think you&#039;ll find it less crowded. Also, try walking upriver a ways. Generally the &quot;domingueros&quot; don&#039;t make it terribly far.</description>

		<description>Yes, Sunday lunch on the terraza at Casa Mingo, followed by a stroll down the river nearby is one of my favourite summer pastimes. I guess they&#039;re not going to redevelop that part of the river because it never had the M30 next to it anyway (though I could be wrong). I went up to La Pedriza last summer but found it too crowded - every swimming hole seemed occupied by bathers. Maybe I just timed it wrong.</description>

		<description>I agree, it&#039;ll be interesting to see how the whole thing turns out. 

The river is also fairly pleasant north of Principe Pío, near the Paseo de la Florida (and a great restaurant, Casa Mingo). But I have to say my favorite spot on the Manzanares is up in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/2007/12/05/around-madrid-la-pedriza/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;La Pedriza&lt;/a&gt;, where I&#039;ve swum twice in great swimming holes (and plan to go back for more this summer!).</description>

		<description>It has been interesting to see such a project take shape. A few years ago Madrid was permanently &quot;patas arriba&quot; because the council decided not only to build the tunnels for the M30, but also to carry out other major roadworks, and to even close a couple of metro lines for good measure. All at the same time. 

I couldn&#039;t believe how a council could have the right to cut off whole barrios without any apparent consultation (Legazpi was left without a metro and bus service for the entire summer). On top of that, the works took place without the required environmental impact study (the council tried to get round this by claiming the M30 was a regular city street!), caused immense polution due to the dust thrown up, and nearly dried up Madrid&#039;s water supply because it all happened during a drought.

But then again, I have always admired how quickly things actually get pushed through here compared to England (where it would probably still be in the consultation stage). Now that the worst is over I can&#039;t wait until the river development is complete. Madrid has been crying out for this.</description>
