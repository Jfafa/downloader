		<description>[...] Whether you’re looking for a new friend or just good conversation, the intercambio is one of the most useful tools to help the expat assimilate to his new home (or to help any local to get away from it all). Luckily, it’s also a million times easier than finding an apartment. But where to start? [...]</description>

		<description>I seem to remember you also have the choice of free expat magazines (normally available in Irish pubs) where they have &quot;to let&quot; advertising (In-Madrid is one, I forget the names of the others). Again you have to be quick though!</description>

		<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.innovate.es&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Innova&lt;/a&gt; offers a brilliant service. They&#039;ll find you a place, negotiate with the landlord and check out the lease. They speak English, French, Portuguese and Spanish. We used them when we had reached the point of despair, and their fee was very reasonable.</description>

		<description>I&#039;ve often used the services of Madridrooms.co.uk to find accommodation initially when I&#039;ve come to Madrid. It takes away the pressure for a month or two (and you can stay for a longer  period if you so choose). Okay, so it operates like an agency but the small fee involved (I believe it was 50 Euros although that may have changed now) is worthwhile to avoid the stress (and cost) of staying in a hostel and trudging around different barrios in your first weeks.</description>
