			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/wp-content/uploads/ceilan.gif" align="left" alt="Sri Lankan food in Madrid" />What, did someone mention good Asian food in Madrid? Surely not? Oh yes, it&#8217;s true my friends, at last we have found somewhere to eat really fine Asian cuisine in the capital. We know that the <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/2007/02/14/indian-restuarants-in-madrid-by-rafe-jaffrey/">Indian restaurants in Madrid</a> aren&#8217;t up to much, and I&#8217;m still looking to find a decent place that serves Thai, but never mind: Sri Lankan food is the way forward!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sabordeceilan.com/">Sabor de Ceil√°n</a>, at  C/ Alonso Heredia, 9 (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=Alonso+Heredia,+9,+madrid&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=48.374125,82.265625&#038;layer=&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;om=1&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr">map</a>) is run by a Spanish lady and her Sri Lankan husband, both effortlessly nice, and if you are feeling lazy, excellent English speakers. They are in the great position of being able to offer a mixed lunchtime menu of both Sri Lankan and Spanish dishes at the same time. We ate here at night, again with a very reasonably priced set menu, and went Sri Lanka all the way down the line, in my case starting with wonderful spring rolls, followed by a generous plate of beef curry with all the trimmings. You have to remember to ask them to add the spice &#8211; the dishes are normally toned down for Spanish tastes. Desert was a slightly inventive ginger and choclate cake (I might go for the Brownie next time), followed up by a complimentary liquer (I always go Spanish here and hit the Pacharan). Definitely worth the trip over to Diego de Leon.</p>
