			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img id="image217" src="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/wp-content/uploads/city-yoga.jpg" alt="City Yoga"  align= "right" />Yoga is a great way to get a workout, relax, and focus on things you easily forget in the hubbub of city life. The offering of yoga classes in Madrid is quite diverse, both in terms of styles and centers. Centers run the gamut from one-room studios with small classes to multi-room New York-style centers with all the requisite amenities. Where you decide to practice yoga in this city will depend on what you’re looking for, be it a studio close to your house, a particular style, or the right class schedule. Most centers will let you do a trial class either for free or for a nominal fee.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.city-yoga.com/">City Yoga</a> is one of the bigger (and posher) studios in the city, and offers everything from a variety of styles of yoga to pilates, as well as various massages and therapies. <a href="http://www.city-yoga.com/horarios_y_precios_clases.html">Schedules</a> are very accommodating, as there are classes available all day during the week and Saturday mornings. Yoga class size can reach a maximum of 20 students.</p>

<p><strong>Metro:</strong> Islas Filipinas <strong>Address:</strong> C/ Cea Bermudez, 66 5A3 <strong>Phone:</strong> 91 442 3288. <span id="more-216"></span></p>

<p><a href="http://www.yogacentersc.es/index.asp">Yoga Center</a>, a bigger center reminiscent of City Yoga. <strong>Metro:</strong> Retiro <strong>Address: </strong>C/ Serrano, 6 bajo 4 <strong>Phone:</strong> 91 575 1913.<br />
<a href="http://www.bikramyoga.es/ConjuntoMad.html"><br />

<p><em>Cocido</em> is a very filling stew, especially recommended for cold winter days, or for when you have been toiling away in the open air and need to get some of your energies back.</p>
<p>It is usually served in two stages. The first consists of a broth, straight from a large pan where all the stew&#8217;s meat has been slowly simmering all morning. The second course is usually presented in a tray placed in the middle of the table containing chickpeas, cabagge, potato, carrot, and all the meat: beef, chicken, ham, <em>chorizo</em> and sometimes <em>morcilla</em> (black pudding).</p>
<p>In the late forties and most of the fifties, when Spain was quite poor, this dish was served in many houses in Madrid six days a week. The exception was Sundays, when something special, like roast chicken, would be prepared.</p>
<p><strong>Where can I have <em>cocido</em>?</strong></p>
<p>• In Madrid, it’s very common to find <em>cocido</em> on Tuesday’s <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/2008/03/24/what-is-a-menu-del-dia/"><em>menú del día</em></a>. It usually appears as two dishes on the menu: the soup as <em>sopa de cocido</em>, and the rest as <em>segundo de cocido</em>.</p>
<p>• <strong>Taberna Daniela</strong>: <strong>Metro</strong>: Goya, Velázquez, Príncipe de Vergara <strong>Address</strong>: C/ General Pardiñas, 21 <strong>Phone</strong>: 91 575 23 29 <strong>Hours</strong>: Daily 12-17:30 and 20:00-24:00 (to 1:00 Fridays and Saturdays).</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The easiest way for an English-speaking expat to earn a living in this city is to teach English. There’s always demand for teachers—it’s up to you how you decide to market yourself.</p>
<p>There are two main routes you can take to becoming an English teacher: <strong>freelancing</strong>, where you pick your classes and schedule, or <strong>working in academies or language schools</strong>, where you’re guaranteed a certain amount of job (and income) stability.</p>
<p>If you choose to go freelance, put an ad up on <a href="http://madrid.loquo.com/en_us">Loquo</a> (pick “classes” and then “languages”) and don’t forget to mention that <strong>you’re a native</strong>. You can also investigate the classifieds in <a href="http://www.in-madrid.com/default2.htm">InMadrid </a>or any other English-language publication. Finally, it wouldn’t hurt to put up an ad in any of the <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/2008/02/26/where-to-buy-and-sell-second-hand-books-in-madrid/">English-language bookshops</a> around town. As for rates: <strong>aim high, but keep with the going rate</strong>. Ask around to get a feel for how much people are charging.</p>
<p>If you go the academy/language schools route, <a href="http://www.madridteacher.com/indexenglish.html">Madrid Teacher</a> is a great resource. There’s a <a href="http://www.madridteacher.com/pdfs/english-academies-in-madrid.htm">list</a> of many of the city’s academies and then pretty reliable <a href="http://www.madridteacher.com/english_teaching_madrid.htm">reviews</a> of some of them. The site is full of resources for teachers (freelance, too!), so definitely spend a while looking around.</p>
<p>If you’re North American, there’s one more option for teaching English in Madrid: the <a href="http://www.mec.es/exterior/usa/en/programs/us_assistants/default.shtml"><em>auxiliar </em>program</a>. Here you’re not a full-time teacher, instead you work in the public schools <em>helping</em> the English teachers. And since you only work part-time as an <em>auxiliar</em>, you’ll have plenty of free time to pick up some private classes and earn yourself some more money!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You&#8217;ve landed in Madrid, passed through customs, and checked into your temporary digs at one of the city&#8217;s hostels. But you&#8217;re not looking for a whirlwind tour of the Spanish capital. You&#8217;re looking to stay. So, first things first &#8212; how can you find a job in Madrid?</p>
<p>There are two major online job search engines that are used throughout Spain: <a href="http://www.infojobs.net/">infojobs.net</a> and <a href="http://www.infoempleo.com/">infoempleo.com</a>. Both of these sites are extremely user-friendly. You can search the listings (narrowing the search by city, industry, sub-industry and key word) without signing up for the site, but to submit your résumé you&#8217;ll have to join. Both sites are entirely in Spanish, but you will find the occasional listing in English. A bit of advice &#8212; <strong>do some online research to find out the Spanish equivalent to your educational level</strong>. Most listings include the minimum required degree level and it&#8217;s best to know your way around that terminology. Once you&#8217;ve applied to a job you&#8217;ll be able to check your “status” on your private menu. As the companies review your résumé, they can change your status to “in process,” “finalist,” or “discarded.” If you see that you&#8217;re one of the first two, expect a phone call shortly.</p>
<p>Are you looking to work in the hospitality industry? There are listings for these fields on the above-mentioned sites, but your best bet is to wander the streets of the city center (where the bars, restaurants, and hotels are at their densest) searching for help wanted signs. These pop up most frequently in the early summer months when tourism skyrockets. You&#8217;ll do best to <strong>dress professionally, wander with CV in hand, and expect frequent rejections</strong>.<span id="more-194"></span></p>
<p>Speaking of the CV, how should you create your Spanish résumé? Start off with the basic personal information. Strange as it may seem to some expats, in addition to the standard address and contact information, <strong>your résumé should also include your date of birth, nationality, marital status, and a photograph</strong>. From there go on to list your education and work history, and round it out with your special skills &#8212; <strong>highlight your native English</strong>! If you&#8217;re in a business or technical field, try to include specific details of your past projects, including, if possible, project scope and the economic figures. Don&#8217;t forget the cover letter. Most of the listings on InfoJobs and InfoEmpleo require a cover letter to submit your resume. So write up a good one (in Spanish) and get a native to check it for you. In my experience, <strong>that letter can prove more important than the résumé</strong>.</p>
<p>Remember: <strong>Finding work in Spain is made immensely easier by having an <em>enchufe</em></strong>, or a good connection. Family friends, acquaintances, your new landlady&#8217;s brother &#8212; all can lend a major hand in helping find employment. So when you begin your search, be sure to get the word out there.</p>
<p>Finally, are you hoping to teach English (or another language) in Madrid? The rules of the game change a little within this industry, so be sure to check out Katie&#8217;s upcoming post on this topic.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So you’ve got an <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/2008/03/05/how-to-get-an-intercambio-in-madrid/"><em>intercambio</em></a>. Now what? Ideally an <em>intercambio</em> is about fun and learning and perfecting another language. But the first couple times will perhaps feel like something between a job interview and a first date. Keep these tips in mind to make sure things flow smoothly. </p>
<p>1. <strong>Pick a good place</strong>. Hopping <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/category/bars/">bars</a>, sidewalk terraces, busy <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/category/madrid-parks/">parks</a> – places primed for people-watching provide an endless supply of conversation topics to get the ball rolling.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Be on time and wear something bright</strong>.  Meeting in a public place with someone that you’ve never even seen before is mildly nerve-wracking. Make it easier on the other person by wearing <em>algo llamativo</em> (something attention-getting).</p>
<p>3. <strong>Don’t be shy</strong>. Striking up conversation with a total stranger can be somewhat daunting. Chalk it up to a good experience and jump in with both feet.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Don’t talk too much</strong>.  Hint: <em>Intercambio</em> means interchange. </p>
<p>5. <strong>Don’t be too nice</strong>. Correcting someone else’s speech doesn’t always come easily (unless you were born with the teacher gene). But if you don’t do it then there’s really not much point to the whole get-together.  You’re both there to improve so don’t take offense and don’t keep quiet.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re not too fussed about staying in a hotel, Madrid&#8217;s <em>hostales</em> are often homier and better value. Generally speaking, these are clean and friendly places with basic amenities and the price to match. What could be better than having more of your budget to spend on eating, drinking, and sightseeing in this fantastic city?</p>
<p>We who live in Madrid are, of course, not the experts on places to stay. I&#8217;ve taken a place that I know plus other personal recommendations to make this list. I&#8217;ll leave the rest up to you in the comments.</p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.ihostales.com/english/ficha.php?id=35">Hostal Angelines</a>: small and family-run with just six rooms. Very close to Moncloa and the University, putting you in a residential neighborhood that&#8217;s close walking distance to the true center of the city. A single or double will set you back only 40 euros or 45 euros a night, respectively.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.hostalmarialuisa.com/">Hostal María Luisa</a>: similar to the one above with the main difference being that it&#8217;s in <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/category/by-barrio/chueca/">Chueca</a>, i.e. a very happening place to be. Just <a href="http://www.hostalmarialuisa.com/Ehabitaciones.html">a little more expensive</a> than Angelines.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.hostalcruzsol.com/">Hostal Cruz Sol</a> and <a href="http://www.hostalsantacruz.com/ingles/index.html">Hostal Santa Cruz</a> are both recommended by Gary from over at the Notes from Spain forum. They&#8217;re in the same building set on a plaza just steps from <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/2007/10/05/avoid-eating-in-the-plaza-mayor/">Plaza Mayor</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m going to leave you with a <a href="http://travelqa.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/05/madrid-hostals-as-an-alternative-to-hotels/">great travel Q&#038;A</a> on the subject from the <em>New York Times</em> that gives several more worthwhile recommendations.	</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether you’re looking for a new friend or just good conversation, the <em>intercambio</em> is one of the most useful tools to help the expat assimilate to his new home (or to help any local to get away from it all). Luckily, it’s also a million times easier than <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/2008/02/20/how-to-find-a-room-in-madrid/">finding an apartment</a>. But where to start?</p>
<p>Make your first stop the forum at <a href="http://www.notesfromspain.com">Notes from Spain</a>. Find a post or place your own under the <a href="http://www.notesfromspain.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=27">Intercambios/Pen Pals</a> section and you’re sure to find others looking for the same &#8212; cyber or real. Other great resources are <a href="http://madrid.loquo.com/cs/comunidad/intercambio-de-idiomas/103">Loquo</a> and <a href="http://madrid.en.craigslist.es/stp/">craigslist</a>. Most English language magazines available have a section dedicated to the hunt as well. </p>
<p>Be sure also to look into the various language nights offered throughout the city. Located in bars and <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/2008/02/26/where-to-buy-and-sell-second-hand-books-in-madrid/">bookshops</a> and typically starting after dinner, they are the perfect chance to meet a conversation partner. (See details below.)</p>
<p>Remember also that <em>intercambios</em> are like doctors &#8212; you can find a really good one by referral.  So ask around &#8212; at your language school, at the gym, among your friends, and their friends, and their friends’ friends. The <em>intercambio</em> “market” is ever increasing and within those seven degrees of separation you’ll certainly find a willing candidate. <span id="more-165"></span></p>
<p>Things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>The term “market” can be all too true as plenty of people looking for an “intercambio” are also looking for love. If that’s not your goal make it clear early on, so you and your friend are on the same page.
</li>
<li>Intercambios are definitely not limited to “English and …”. Plenty of the aforementioned resources include people looking for a wide variety of languages, including French, Italian, German, Japanese, and even, on one recent Craig’s List posting, American Sign Language!</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that you’ve found an <em>intercambio</em>, keep your eyes out for the coming post on <strong>how to be a good one</strong>.</p>
<p>More details:</p>
<p>Language exchanges:</p>
<p><strong>O’Neills</strong>: C/ Principe, 12 <strong>Metro</strong>: Sol <strong>Tuesdays 22h</strong>.<br />
<strong>Café Madrid</strong>: C/ Mesón de Paños, 6 <strong>Metro</strong>: Opera <strong>Wednesdays 21.30h</strong>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img id="image160" src="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/wp-content/uploads/bacchus-bar.jpg" alt="Bacchus Bar and Bookshop" align="right" />If you didn’t bother bringing your whole library with you to Madrid, have no fear. Madrid is home to several quality second-hand English bookshops for all your literary needs. The story doesn’t end at books, either: you can take advantage of <strong>free WiFi</strong>, <em>intercambio</em> and quiz nights, and liquid refreshment, too. And when you finish your books, you can always sell them back.<br />
<strong><br />
Petra’s International Bookshop</strong> is a cozy spot with floor to ceiling bookshelves filled with books in all subject areas and many languages (beyond the usual suspects of English, French, and German to Russian, Chinese, and Japanese). Petra’s has a great selection (perhaps the best of the bunch) and offers complimentary coffee and tea to its patrons as well. </p>
<p><strong>Metro</strong>: Ópera, Santo Domingo <strong>Address</strong>: C/ Campomanes, 13 <strong>Phone</strong>: 91 541 72 91 <strong>Hours</strong>: 11:00-21:00, closed Sundays.</p>
<p><strong>J &#038; J Books and Coffee</strong> is practically an institution in this city, not only for its books, but for its nightly events that nearly always draw a big crowd of expats and English-hungry Spaniards. Tuesdays are teachers’ nights with discounts on teaching materials, Wednesday and Thursday nights are for <em>intercambios</em> (Thursday is more popular), Friday nights there’s a pub quiz at 11, and Saturday nights are all you can drink for 12 euros (beer on tap and wine). There’s free WiFi too.</p>
<p><strong>Metro</strong>: Noviciado <strong>Address</strong>: C/ Espíritu Santo, 47 <strong>Phone</strong>: 91 521 85 76 <strong>Hours</strong>: Monday-Thursday 11:00-24:00; Friday and Saturday 11:00-2:30; Sunday 16:00-22:00.<br />
<strong><br />
Bacchus Bar and Bookshop</strong> is the newcomer to the bunch and is positioned perfectly in a student-heavy neighborhood. In the style of J &#038; J, it has a bar, plenty of books, WiFi, and nightly events. Mondays from 8 to 9 there’s a <em>tertulia</em> (get-together) in English for the non-native speakers out there, Tuesdays there’s an <em>intercambio</em> at 8 with happy hour the two hours before (to get you loosened up, one would suppose?). And their quiz night is Wednesday at 9.</p>
<p><strong>Metro</strong>: Moncloa, Argüelles <strong>Address</strong>: C/ Meléndez Valdés, 52 <strong>Phone</strong>: 91 544 73 78 <strong>Hours</strong>: 17:00-1:00 (24:00 midweek), Sunday 11:00-1:00.</p>
<p>See map below for bookshop locations:<span id="more-159"></span></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Madrid being the capital of one of Europe’s most popular Mediterranean countries, it will not come as a surprise that housing its four million or so inhabitants is (to put it mildly) an issue of concern. The city rivals its sisters in Northern Europe in price; and with wages often being twice as low as “up North”, problems are bound to arise. As such, Madrid has taken the phenomenon of sharing an apartment to a whole different level: no longer simply a student affair, you may find yourself living with <em>madrileños</em> of all ages and occupations, couples included. Check your cupboards, you might find another flatmate in there.</p>
<p>Most newly arrived will not have the means to rent (let alone <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/2008/02/11/how-to-buy-a-flat-in-madrid/">buy</a>!) a place by themselves, and are consequently thrown into the madness of a market that is ruled by “castings” in <em>pisos</em> (apartments) of varying merit. How to become one of the lucky ones? The Internet, as is so often the case, is where it all happens:</p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.loquo.com/">www.loquo.com</a> is arguably the most popular and effective portal: every ten minutes or so, a new <em>habitación</em> (room) is marketed. Select Madrid from the menu on your left, and select <em>compartir piso / alq habitación</em>. The endless list that pops up is, to an extent, of limited use: the good stuff tends to be gone within 24 hours (depending on the <em>zona</em> (neighborhood) – you may still find a spot in Aluche or Carabanchel available after a few days, but don’t bother with anything in <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/category/by-barrio/chueca/">Chueca</a> or Bilbao if you’re late). Regardless of your pickiness, it’s useful to become familiar with the location of the various <em>zonas</em> – they usually refer to metro stations, so get yourself a map of Madrid on which you can easily spot these.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.segundamano.es">www.segundamano.es</a> is another popular one, even though the number of rooms advertised is significantly lower. Select Madrid, then <em>Pisos</em> from the drop-down menu, and mark <em>se alquila</em> before clicking <em>Busca</em> to check what’s on offer. Rumor has it that the print version of Segunda Mano (available at newsstands) has more rooms, which are not advertised on the web.
<li><a href="http://www.pisocompartido.com">www.pisocompartido.com</a> has less visibility but can act as an additional resource. Select <em>Busco habitación en alquiler</em> and MADRID from the drop-down menus.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.idealista.com">www.idealista.com</a> has more search options than the others (smoking vs. non-smoking etc.) and you can select your area by navigating a map of Madrid. Do check the date of posting, however: ads are rarely removed. Start by selecting <em>alquilar</em>, <em>habitación</em> and Madrid from the menus on the main page. <span id="more-158"></span></li>
</ul>
<p>When you have spotted a <em>habitación</em> in a <em>zona</em> that you wouldn’t mind living in, call immediately (sending e-mails will most likely get you nowhere). A basic level of Spanish obviously comes in handy here; fortunately, the conversations tend to follow a very clear pattern: you will typically ask if the room is still available (<em>“he visto vuestro anuncio en loquo.com – la habitación todavía está libre?”</em>), and they will either disappoint you (<em>“ya está alquilada”</em>) or make you happy with a <em>sí</em>. Next thing: <em>cuándo puedo venir?</em> (when can I come to see it?). Make a note of day and time, and head out there. Things to double-check beforehand could be: <em>está amueblada?</em> (does it have all its furniture in place? unless, of course, you have your own somewhere in a truck), and: <em>los gastos están incluidos?</em> (are water, electricity etc. included in the amount?).</p>
<p>If you like what you have been invited to see, it is up to you to use your (foreign, mysterious) charm to pass the audition (there are typically between 5 and 20 contestants, depending on <em>zona</em> and season). Note that most <em>habitaciones</em> call for a <em>fianza</em> (deposit), usually one month’s worth of rent.</p>
<p><em>¡Suerte!</em> (Good luck)</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img id="image151" alt="Se Vende" src="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/wp-content/uploads/flat.jpg" align= "right" />In some ways buying property is easier than renting in Madrid (and prices right now are static if not falling); but here are some points to bear in mind:</p>
<p>1.    <strong>Have a lot of cash.</strong> Although prices in the Spanish capital compare well with some countries, be aware that secondary costs (i.e. taxes and Dickensian bureaucracy) mean that you should count on paying 20% more than the price of the flat, up front.</p>
<p>2.    <strong>Be legit.</strong> Anglo-Saxon minds may boggle at the rigidity of Spanish banks, who will only consider giving you a mortgage if you have a fixed, permanent employment contract. On the bright side, a friend of mine recently got a &#8211; to her mind temporary &#8211; job through the <a href="http://www.adecco.es/Home/Home.aspx">Adecco</a> employment agency, for which she was given an immediate <em>contrato fijo</em>.</p>
<p>3.    <strong>Narrow your desires.</strong> Focusing on a particular <em>barrio</em> means you can wander the streets looking for private <em>Se Vende</em> (For Sale) signs. An agent-free process should in theory get you a better deal. The most essential thing either way is to secure a copy of the <em>nota simple informativa</em> (<em>del Registro de la Propiedad</em>), which proves that the seller is the person they claim to be, and that the property is free of debts.</p>
<p>4.    <strong>(But) don&#8217;t be scared of agents.</strong> It&#8217;s the reverse situation to the banks: estate agents here are a breath of fresh air in comparison to some of the sharks I&#8217;ve dealt with in the UK. Honest, punctual and friendly, I was very pleased with the service of everyone but <a href="http://www.tecnocasa.es/">Tecnocasa</a>, a mercenary chain to be avoided like the plague.</p>
<p>5.    <strong>Ask questions.</strong> In addition to deciding what&#8217;s essential to you (natural light, elevator, terrace etc.), brush up on other factors such as the monthly <em>comunidad</em> fee and status of the ITE (building maintenance and inspection, respectively). I drew quick plans of every place I saw and built an Excel sheet to cross-reference features and prices. I didn&#8217;t regret it.</p>
