In summer, terrazas fill the plaza with metal tables and chairs, and chances are that you will have to wait for a seat. To offset all those dobles you&#8217;ll be pouring into your gut, grab something to eat at one of the two pizzerias opposite each other on the square, the inventive Maravillas or the more traditional Sandos.

		<description>Well, I suppose I did only wander around Madrid for one day last Easter, so I will take your word for it - forget Easter (we should all be in Andalucia then anyway!)</description>

		<description>i have to agree that september is lovely, but wanted to disagree with semana santa. during the one i&#039;ve spent in madrid nearly EVERYTHING in my neighborhood (near moncloa) was closed (most notably grocery stores and bars) and the main place things were open was the true center, and that was mobbed by english-speaking tourists! perhaps this is more disturbing for me than for the tourists, but those who come during semana santa most likely won&#039;t see many locals. for that reason late spring and early fall are ideal to have a true madrid experience.</description>
