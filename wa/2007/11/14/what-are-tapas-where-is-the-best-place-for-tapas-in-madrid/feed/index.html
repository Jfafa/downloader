		<description>Great post, thank you! Among the many choices, try out Baco y Beto, in C/ Pelayo 24 in Chueca...the most amazing tapas, and the wine-cart is always excellent! Great service, warm atmosphere...one of my favorite places in Madrid...</description>

		<description>[...] For one, there are dozens of tapas bars. I recommend gambas at La Casa del Abuelo (C/ Goya, 57; C/ Núñez de Arce, 5) , patatas bravas at Las Bravas (C/ Álvarez Gato, 3; Pasaje Matheu, 5; C/ de la Cruz, 14 ; C/ Espoz y Mina, 13), and tostas at La Malaspina (C/ Cádiz, 9) , but those are just starting points. Good bars are littered on and around the streets Calle de Espoz y Mina and Calle de la Cruz. Explore and experiment! [...]</description>

		<description>I&#039;ve had great tapas at a place in Chueca called Bocaito, on C/ Libertad, 4.  All the seafood I&#039;ve tried there is good, although I haven&#039;t had any bacalo</description>

		<description>Actually I also know a place famous for its Bacalo, however even if that is the speciality of the bar they do serve other things. It is called Casa Revuelta and it is in c/Latoneras, 3 - Right next to the Plaza Mayor.</description>

		<description>So, today I noticed a place I&#039;ve passed before called &quot;La Casa del Bacalao&quot;. It&#039;s on C/ Tortosa, 1 right by the Atocha train station. I can&#039;t say I&#039;ve tried it, but they seem to proudly tout the focus on bacalao in their choice of name.</description>

		<description>@Gary: Don&#039;t worry we will keep on adding other places on to the Tapas Bars section, and we will try to cover different areas of Madrid.

@Valencia Son: Of course we&#039;ve tried Cochinillo!!! I&#039;m not a big meat fan, but I&#039;ll go out of my way to eat a nice cochinillo. 

I&#039;ve never heard of this bar where they only serve Bacalo, but near Sol there used to be a few streets where each bar offered a different tapas speciality: Prawns in one or mushrooms in the other. Maybe it was in the same area. We will have to investigate if they are all still there at some point!!!</description>

		<description>Those tapas look great. Have you tried cochinillo? I spoke to my father regarding Venencia and he doesn&#039;t think that is the place he went to in Madrid where just about all they serve is bacalao and vino. Perhaps I should know better Ben then to expect you to show up at a place that only serves bacalao but I thought I&#039;d take a shot anyway. I think my father said it was near Plaza del Sol.</description>

		<description>Now you have whet our appetites I would love more... suggestions for idas de tapas (?) in different areas of madrid - Pl Santa Ana is easy  but it would be great if you name some names of bars in Chueca and other areas.

La Latina is a great place for tapas - is Taberna del Almendro the same as Taberna Almendro 13 where they serve the great roscas?</description>
