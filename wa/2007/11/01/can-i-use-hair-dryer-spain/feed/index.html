		<description>@Delmar: I&#039;ve been using my iBook in Spain with an adapter for over two years with no problems at all! Sounds like yours was a problem with the computer battery itself.

@Amy: Dang! A 15-pound transformer?! I hope that&#039;s worth it! Glad to hear that it works, though. Is it strange that I&#039;ve never used a crock pot in my life?</description>

		<description>I fried a CD-player alarm clock years ago.  I thought I was doing the right thing by using a converter, but it turns out that there is ALSO a special kind of converter designed for electronics!  It was under warranty from Sears so I got a new one but I later read the fine print and found out that lots of warranties are void if you take the item out of the country.  Of course that&#039;s hard to prove.  Also, before coming this time I bought a massive step-down transformer that can handle up to 750 watts (and weighs about 15 pounds) so that I can use my Crock Pot.</description>

		<description>I brought over a new Macbook to use while working for a year in Madrid.  It didn&#039;t burn out while I was in Spain, but a day after I got back to the U.S. the battery died.  Luckily I had extended coverage, so I didn&#039;t have to pay for a new one.</description>
