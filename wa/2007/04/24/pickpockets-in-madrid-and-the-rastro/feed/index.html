		<description>It is so, so sad. For Madrid and the people who live there who are honest. Everyone I know who&#039;s been to Madrid or Barcelona has the same story.Personally I&#039;ve been robbed twice in a year in Madrid. It has never happened before. I&#039;ve travelled a lot for 30 years. It makes me furios how they destroy peoples holidays and they get away with it. There  should be a lot more policemen or some other precaution like cameras photografing the pickpockets. Why would it be worse in Spain than anywhere else in Europe. The police are so used to it they don&#039;t even understand it&#039;s a big problem. Personally  will never go back.</description>

		<description>[...] So you have spent Sunday morning on the steep slopes of El Rastro. You have been all the way to the bottom and now you have climbed back to the top again. You have enjoyed browsing around the stalls, if not the crush of people and having to keep a wary eye out for pick-pockets. Now you fancy a drink, hot or cold, and perhaps a bite to eat.

		<description>I was pickpocked recently, in the Madrid metro. It was hot and I was carrying my large jacket in my hands, which meant my jean pocket was exposed and out of my line of sight. I was also clearly distracted, telling some people I was with a little of the history of Madrid. The fact I was speaking in English probably made matters worse. As a distracted foreigner who can&#039;t see where his wallet is, I was a prime target.

I&#039;ve seen quite a few suspicious folks hanging around the entrance to Metro stops in Madrid recently - much more than when I lived in Madrid a couple of years ago. Be careful.</description>
