		<description>As Julie, I also prefer buying in the small shops. If you do so regularly shop-assistants will get to know your tastes and will offer you those delicious figs that you like so much, or as happened to me last Thursday when I was shopping for a dinner party, the fishmonger suggested how to cook a particular fish or explain different ways to cook &quot;berberechos&quot; (=similar to clams): &quot;al vapor&quot; (=steamed) or &quot;a la plancha&quot; (=grilled with garlic and parsley). Note that also in the markets these days is common to find a delicatessen or two with delicious things from around the world.</description>
