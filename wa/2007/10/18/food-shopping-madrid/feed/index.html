		<description>[...] We may have lived here years, but some memories never leave us. Is it Marmite, Horlicks or HP Sauce you suddenly get the urge to taste again? How about some Branston Pickle? PG Tips? Maynards Wine gums? But you will search the shelves of El Cortes Inglés in vain. There are just some things you miss. [...]</description>

		<description>I do visit El Corte Inglés supermarket every now and then to find coconut milk, fragant Thai rice, or my favourite, the little Thai yellow mangos which I haven&#039;t been able to find elsewhere in Madrid. However, to get oriental food and fresh herbs at a better price I recommend visiting any Chinese or Indian shop in Lavapies district.</description>

		<description>I confess that I am a fan of their food section... that said, I am pretty sure that you could find all of these products elsewere in Madrid. But the convenience of having them all under one roof must be appreciated.</description>

		<description>I cross over to the dark side because of a weakness for German wheat beer and because sometimes it&#039;s the only place where you can reliably find things like fresh milk. On the Asian side, I am sure there are better places. On the &quot;short&quot; part of San Bernardo, between the Gran Via and Santo Domingo, there is a run down shopping centre which has a shop selling Indian, Chinese, Thai and Japanese foods and sauces. The Chinese guy who runs it is very nice and it&#039;s a better alternative to putting more money into the Corte Inglés.</description>

		<description>Good call. As much as I dislike this overpriced we-sell-everything store, the supermarket is high quality and I&#039;ve found things there that I haven&#039;t been able to find elsewhere (like creme fraiche, which I&#039;ve substituted for sour cream). But just don&#039;t do your regular shopping there! Every time I go in I see the same products as at my local supermarkets but with incredibly marked up prices.</description>
