<p>According to Damian Corrigan at <a href="http://www.gospain.about.com">gospain.about.com</a>, <em>Noche en Blanco</em> &#8220;is an all-night cultural extravaganza which takes place on one night each September (in 2007 it will take place on the night of September 22). Everything is free of charge and the city puts on 24 hour public transport to make getting between events easier.&#8221;</p>
<p>As well as free entry to most of the major museums throughout the night, musical offerings include shows from Daft Punk, Strange Fruits, Macanique Vivante and Fátima Miranda. For full details check out <a href="http://gospain.about.com/od/september/qt/noche_en_blanco.htm">Damian&#8217;s write up</a> at about.com, or the <a href="http://lanocheenblanco.esmadrid.com/lanocheenblanco/nocheenblancomadrid/presentacion.do?idioma=es">official Spanish site</a>.

<p>Everyone who decides to have lunch in Madrid&#8217;s Plaza Mayor soon discovers that they have made a huge mistake. The <em>Menu del Dia</em> (lunchtime set menu) is far too expensive and usually not all that good. Walk a few minutes in any direction however, and you are likely to be far better off. My personal favourite for a <em>Menu del Dia</em> near the Plaza Mayor is Refra, at Calle Santiago 4 (just across the Calle Mayor - <a href="http://www.google.com/maps?hl=en&#038;safe=off&#038;q=refra&#038;near=Madrid,+Spain&#038;radius=0.0&#038;cd=1&#038;cid=40416712,-3703270,17165291212582245669&#038;li=lmd&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;om=1&#038;ll=40.4162,-3.709248&#038;spn=0.005685,0.01001&#038;z=17&#038;iwloc=A">Map</a>).</p>
<p>For 8.50 inside and 10.50 on the terrace, you get around 5 starters, 5 main courses and 5 deserts to choose from, in what is basically a top quality working man&#8217;s lunchtime menu served in a friendly, family-run establishment. You will be eating with the locals, you won&#8217;t get ripped off, and you will leave more than satisfied. I ate here almost every day for three months whilst living in the Hostal Santiago opposite (<a href="http://www.notesfromspain.com/errant-in-iberia/">see book for details</a>!), so I know what I&#8217;m talking about!

<div class="contenttext">
<p>Pickpocketing and theft are a problem in Madrid but it is not something to worry about if you take a few sensible precautions. Obvious things to AVOID are carrying your wallet in your back pocket, or valuables in a back pack on your back - both are asking for trouble. Handbags should be carried under your arm. Be very careful not to leave bags next to you on the floor in bars or restaurants - keep them on your lap. Pickpockets and bag snatchers tend to work in pairs or small groups in Madrid and often one or two members of a gang will distract you (by shoving you, asking an innocent question, showing you a map) while another robs you - be particularly aware in the Metro and around major tourist attractions such as museums. Again, there is no need to be paranoid all the time, but if you are aware of this problem then you are bound to be fine. </p>
<p>What follows in an excellent example of the tricks used in Madrid these days, from Julian, who was on holiday in Madrid with his wife Judith, and was targeted the <a href="http://www.notesfromspain.com/583/">Rastro market.</a></p>
<blockquote><p>So having walked round the Rastro &#038; flea market, Judith &#038; I had bought a few items &#038; were heading out when I got targeted as the victim of a &#8216;contrived accident&#8217;. I knew all about this possibility &#038; Ben had warned us not to have anything of value on us.</p>
<p>It was skilfully carried out because it was made to look as if I had tried to rob the pickpocket.</p>
<p>He was just ahead &#038; was holding a mobile (probably an old broken one) close to his ear. He swung round backwards &#038; bumped into me - the mobile was dropped (flung) against my leg as I walked forward &#8212; thus sending the mobile skittering off a few feet away. Instead of just retrieving it - he bent down &#038; grabbed one of my legs with one hand while with the other made a show of frisking my leg where the mobile had hit it, i.e. trying to make it look as if I had deliberately tried to pinch his mobile.</p>
<p>My wallet was in my front pocket out of harms way and I had a firm grip on it. I freed myself quickly from this &#038; he picked up his mobile from the ground.</p>
<p>But the distraction had enabled his accomplice (who I never saw) to remove the contents of my back pocket &#8230; just a few sheets of folded A4 paper.</p>
<p>No harm done but it shows that despite taking all precautions the pickpockets can still catch you unawares.</p>
<p>This all happened so quickly that Judith who was walking slightly ahead of me carried on &#038; hadn&#8217;t even noticed what had happened.</p></blockquote>

<p>We drew up a map this weekend to help show a group of friends around some of our favourite La Latina bars. This is one of the greatest barrios in Madrid for feasting on tapas - Cava Baja has around 40 bars alone! The map is available here below, and includes the following bars:</p>
<p>Toma Jamon, El Viajero, Taberna del Almendro (<a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/2007/02/01/taberna-del-almendro-from-michael-carlin/">full review</a>), La Concha, Delic Cafe, Berlin Cabaret, La Solea, and Sanlucar.</p>
<p>We hope to provide in-depth reviews of all the bars soon!</p>

<p>Tucked away in a very narrow street in the heart of old Madrid (Calle de la Paz, 4 - <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Calle+de+la+Paz,+4,+28012,+Madrid,+Madrid,+Madrid,+Spain&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;hl=en&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=32.885543,82.265625&#038;z=16&#038;ll=40.416208,-3.704216&#038;spn=0.007711,0.020084&#038;om=1&#038;iwloc=addr">map</a>),  this authentic Castillian bar doesn&#8217;t seem to have changed at all in the last 50 years. It&#8217;s speciality is a delicious sweet wine and a dessert known as &#8220;Torrijas&#8221; which, although usually only on sale in <em>Pastelarias</em> at Easter, can be found at this bar all year round. Originally meant as an energy-boosting meat substitute over Easter and Lent, the ingredients of &#8220;Torrijas de leche&#8221; are really basic: hard bread is usually soaked in cinnamon and lemon-scented milk until the bread goes soft, before it is coated with beaten egg and deep fried in olive oil. Finally a bit of icing sugar is sprinkled on top. La Casa de las Torrijas specialises in the less-common, but no less delicious, &#8220;Wine Torrijas&#8221;.

<p><img src="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/wp-content/uploads/ceilan.gif" align="left" alt="Sri Lankan food in Madrid" />What, did someone mention good Asian food in Madrid? Surely not? Oh yes, it&#8217;s true my friends, at last we have found somewhere to eat really fine Asian cuisine in the capital. We know that the <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/2007/02/14/indian-restuarants-in-madrid-by-rafe-jaffrey/">Indian restaurants in Madrid</a> aren&#8217;t up to much, and I&#8217;m still looking to find a decent place that serves Thai, but never mind: Sri Lankan food is the way forward!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sabordeceilan.com/">Sabor de Ceilán</a>, at  C/ Alonso Heredia, 9 (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=Alonso+Heredia,+9,+madrid&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=48.374125,82.265625&#038;layer=&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;om=1&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr">map</a>) is run by a Spanish lady and her Sri Lankan husband, both effortlessly nice, and if you are feeling lazy, excellent English speakers. They are in the great position of being able to offer a mixed lunchtime menu of both Sri Lankan and Spanish dishes at the same time. We ate here at night, again with a very reasonably priced set menu, and went Sri Lanka all the way down the line, in my case starting with wonderful spring rolls, followed by a generous plate of beef curry with all the trimmings. You have to remember to ask them to add the spice - the dishes are normally toned down for Spanish tastes. Desert was a slightly inventive ginger and choclate cake (I might go for the Brownie next time), followed up by a complimentary liquer (I always go Spanish here and hit the Pacharan). Definitely worth the trip over to Diego de Leon.</p>

<p>After around a decade of closure due to lack of sufficient public interest, Madrid&#8217;s <em>Hipódromo</em> horse racing track reopened last year. Today marked the beginning of the new season, which runs through to July 19th. This is an extremely pleasurable way to spend a Sunday morning, especially a sunny one like today&#8217;s! There are five to six races through the morning, running from 11.15 to 2 p.m., though arriving around 10.45 gives you time to find your way around and get your first bets down.</p>
<p>The betting is where the fun lies. The minimum bet is 1 Euro, and you can place a range of different bets which are initially somewhat complicated to master. A <em>Ganador</em> bet is easy, you bet on the winner, but won&#8217;t reap huge rewards if your horse comes in first. Better is to go for a <em>Gemela reversible</em>, where you pick the first two horses past the post, and win no matter what order they come in. A <em>Trio no reversible</em> means picking first, second and third past the post, in the right order - get that right and you stand to win a lot of money. There are others, but that&#8217;s as far as I got! One thing I noticed is that if you don&#8217;t bet on a particular race, it&#8217;s really a lot less fun to watch.</p>
<p>What is strange is that there is no way to work out the odds before you bet. Whereas in the UK you know that a certain horse has odds of 5 to 1 to win, and can work out your winnings when you place your bet, here you have to wait until the race is over and the payouts for each type of bet are placed up on a board behind the paddock.</p>
<p>So, you spend the morning wandering from the paddock (to check out the horses and riders as they saddle up), to the track, to the betting booths, stopping every now and again for a beer or Butifarra sandwich, people watching, cheering on your horses&#8230; great stuff. My total winnings for the day? Zero. I lost a grand total of 12 Euros, and it was worth every centimo! There are more photos from the day <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/spanishben/sets/72157600026485989/">over at Flickr</a>, and a short video below (from our <a href="http://www.notesinspanish.com/2007/03/24/11m-a-notes-in-spanish-vlog/">Spanish videoblogging collection</a>!)</p>

<p>Zinc bar top and <em>vermut</em> on tap. Marvelous. How long can this sort of place last? As long as the owners I suppose, and it looks like this lot have a few years behind the bar in them yet, thank goodness.</p>
<p>Get down to Calle San Andrés 4 (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=San+Andres+4,+28004+Madrid&#038;layer=&#038;sll=37.181228,-3.599439&#038;sspn=0.024721,0.040169&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;om=1&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr">map</a>) ASAP and order that <em>vermut</em>. Oh, and going to the toilet is quite an experience&#8230; I&#8217;ll let you find that out for yourself!

If you like the idea of artistic shots of some of the most famous ladies from the last 50 years of film and fashion then pop down to this end of Madrid (it&#8217;s a five minute walk from Menedez Pelayo Metro station at Calle Fuenterrabía, 4-6 - <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=Fuenterrab%C3%ADa,+4-6,+madrid&#038;layer=&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=49.891082,82.265625&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;z=16&#038;om=1&#038;iwloc=addr">map</a>). The exhibition runs until April 17th - half an hour in the company of these women is invogorating, inspiring stuff!</p>
<p>Question, where else can you see good photography exhibits in Madrid?

<p>While some people are still heating their flats with individual <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/2007/03/07/madrid-characters-1-the-gas-man/">bottles of Butane gas</a>, most of the buildings in our <em>barrio</em> have central heating - meaning that one big old boiler in the basement pumps hot water around the radiators in the whole building. The upside is pretty powerful heating, the downside is that you have no control over when the heating comes on - in our building it runs from 1 pm through to Midnight, from around November to April.</p>
<p>Many of these monstrous basement boilers are still fed on lumps of coal, and it is not uncommon to see a lorry like this parked somewhere down our street once a week, with grubby young men wheeling barrow load after barrow load of coal from the back of the truck, in through the flat block front door, and down into the basement. What I&#8217;d like to know is who spends day and night shoveling it into the furnace once it gets there?

<p>There&#8217;s nothing like finding a view over the roofs of Madrid&#8230; This one is from a roof terrace high up in the <em>Barrio</em> of Noviciado. The owner of the flat attached to the view told me that before they lived there it had been inhabited by quite an interesting group, consisting of a trampy old man, 3 aging prostitutes, and 2 Dobermans - sounds like something straight out of an Almodovar film!</p>

<p>&#8230;and I thought that these days it was only country folk that ordered their gas by the bottle. Apparently not, as the <em>Butanero</em> can still be seen driving his lorry around Madrid. These men are herculean super-machos, capable of hoisting two full gas bottles onto their shoulders and climbing six flights of stairs (I imagine early retirement from crippled backs is common in this game&#8230;) One thing that always worries me though is the constant smell of gas that surrounds the lorries, especially with all the smokers out on the streets of Madrid these days. What the hell would happen to our block of flats if one of these things went BANG outside?!
