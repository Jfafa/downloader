			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/wp-content/uploads/inti.gif" alt="" align="right" />A while ago a colleague recommended El Inca (C/ Ruiz). The food was acceptable but expensive, and as I seem to recall, slightly overcooked. So Peruvian cuisine wasn&#8217;t on my radar when I stumbled across El Inti de Oro. Which was an entirely different matter.</p>
<p>My friend and I opted for the 20€ dinner menu, which kicks off with a non-negotiable platter of national delicacies. We were immediately transported by the ample bowl of <em>ceviche</em> – a kind of sushi in a lemon and onion dressing – and had to force ourselves to leave space for our mains.</p>
<p>We weren&#8217;t disappointed. The chicken in walnut sauce and hake with king prawns were both cooked to perfection; and the homemade desserts that followed deserved much more attention than our strained stomachs could offer them.</p>
<p>The service was impeccable, and the menu includes a Peruvian cocktail, half a bottle of decent wine, and a generous <em>chupito</em> of <em>dulce de leche</em> (shot of toffee liquor!) All in all, one of the best bargains to be found in Madrid.</p>
<p>Good for: groups, or a casual date. Bad for: dieters.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/wp-content/uploads/cine-dore_julie.jpg" alt="Cine Dore" align="left" />Cine Doré is a uniquely nostalgic place in Madrid to watch films ranging from silent gems to modern globe-spanning festival winners. The cinema, constructed in 1923, underwent extensive restoration from 1982 to 1989 and today is kept busy with offerings from the Filmoteca Española (national film library). It offers cinephiles a café, bookstore, and affordable, interesting films not available elsewhere.</p>
<p>If you have the choice, go for a screening in the main Sala 1, which has been reconstructed with the original modernist décor. There are 2-4 screenings nightly, Tuesday-Sunday; all are non-dubbed original versions. The schedule is available in print (in Spanish) at the ticket office, or at the Filmoteca headquarters/exhibition area (C/ Magdalena, 10. Metro: Antón Martín). It is also available on-line <a href="http://www.mcu.es/cine/MC/FE/CineDore/Programacion.html">at the Filmoteca website</a>.</p>
<p>During September and October the first screening of each night is an entry in Spain&#8217;s Premios Goya 2007 competition, so seating is limited. October will also offer examples of contemporary German cinema. Tickets may be bought the day before, from 21:00 until closing or the day of, from 17:15 until 15 minutes before the show begins.</p>
<p>Pricing: 2,50€ a ticket / 10 for 20,00€; students 2,00€ a ticket / 10 for 15,00€<br />
Location: Santa Isabel, 3 (Metro: Antón Martín). Map below: <span id="more-74"></span></p>
