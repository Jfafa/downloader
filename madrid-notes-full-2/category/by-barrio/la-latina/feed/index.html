			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img id="image225" src="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/wp-content/uploads/organillorastro200.jpg" alt="organillorastro.jpg" align="left" />This famous Sunday morning flea market, located next to <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/category/by-barrio/la-latina/">La Latina</a>, one of the oldest quarters of Madrid, has everything from clothes, bags and other paraphernalia, to the funny stalls dedicated to just one single thing: there is one, for example, that sells nothing but various shapes and sizes of elastic bands!</p>
<p>One specific side street is dedicated to pets, with real pet shops on either side of the road, and a few people outside selling their own puppies out of cardboard boxes and sports bags. The main street, c/ Ribera de Curtidores, is the place to head to if you’d like to see antique shops in Madrid, most of which open every day of the week.</p>
<p>There are two extra reasons for visiting the Rastro on a Sunday morning: the first is the live music, from the organ grinder playing Chotis, a popular music and dance from Madrid, to a complete Jazz band if you’re lucky.</p>
<p>The second reason is food: finish your Rastro visit with either the traditional bocadillo de calamares, a battered squid baguette sold in one of the many bars lining the main Rastro strip, or head towards the atmospheric heart of La Latina for lunch in one of the many tapas bars around Plaza de la Cebada and Cava Baja. </p>
<p>TIPS: Go early, from 9:30 to 10:30 a.m., to avoid the masses. Be careful with your wallet, camera and other possessions, as this is <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/2007/04/24/pickpockets-in-madrid-and-the-rastro/">a favourite spot for pickpockets</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Metro:</strong> La Latina / Tirso de Molina. The Rastro is on Calle Ribera de Curtidores and surrounds. See map below:<span id="more-223"></span></p>

<p>You can think of La Latina as <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/2007/11/15/madrid-lavapies-going-out-eating-drinking/">Lavapiés</a>’ more stylish older sister. The neighborhood is one of the most lively in Madrid thanks to the combination of a high concentration of good <em>tapas</em> bars and a young, modern crowd. And it’s happening at about any time of the week. Sundays may be La Latina’s busiest day, with the morning <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Rastro">Rastro</a> and the afternoon spillover into the bars and plazas of the <em>barrio</em>. Enter any bar at about 6 p.m. and it’ll feel like Saturday night all over again.</p>
<p>Ben has already made a fantastic <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/2007/04/24/la-latina-bars-some-of-our-favourites/">map</a> with some of his favorite bars, but here are a few more suggestions for Sundays and beyond:</p>
<p><strong>Drink:</strong> <strong>Taberna Salamanca</strong> is a tiny, old timey place on the famed Cava Baja good for a drink before heading elsewhere—the food is apparently worth it as well. <strong>Barrio Alto</strong> is a stylish yet laid-back bar that boasts cocktails and reasonably priced light meals set to jazz, funk, and more.</p>
<p><strong>Eat:</strong> <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/2007/02/01/taberna-del-almendro-from-michael-carlin/">Taberna El Almendro</a> deserves the first mention for the outstanding price-quality ratio and ambience to boot. <strong>Txakoli</strong> is an excellent Basque <em>pintxos</em> bar with two locations. <strong>Juana La Loca</strong> offers innovative <em>pintxos</em> in a sit-down setting. Some complain it’s overpriced, but it’s worth trying the <em>tortilla de patata</em> with caramelized onions. </p>
<p><strong>Picnic:</strong> Grab a <em>bocadillo</em> from the <strong>Cervecería San Andrés</strong> and join the multitudes sitting in the adjacent plaza on a sunny day at any time of year (see photo above!). You can also head down to the lovely Plaza de la Paja to hit up the brand new second location of <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/2007/12/26/natural-foods-in-madrid/">Viva la Vida</a>, the vegetarian take-away buffet, and eat outside.</p>
<p><strong>Debauch:</strong> One word: <a href="http://contraclub.com/">Contraclub</a>. <em>Copas</em> and great music: funk, soul, rock, etc. No <a href="http://www.los40.com/"><em>40 Principales</em></a> to be found here. Friday and Saturday it&#8217;s open ‘til 6 a.m., with free entry until 2 a.m.</p>
<p><em>What are your favorite spots in La Latina?</em></p>
<p>See map below for all places mentioned above as well as opening hours: <span id="more-152"></span></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Michael Carlin went to Spain on a Fulbright research grant 3 years ago. He was writing a dissertation on twelfth-century liturgical manuscripts from León, and despite going everywhere in Madrid, kept coming back to the Taberna del Almendro:</p>
<blockquote><p><img src="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/wp-content/uploads/almendro.jpg" alt="Taberna del Almendro" align="left" />I know of no more satisfying experience than the Taberna del Almendro at Calle del Almendro 13 (in La Latina &#8211; <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Calle+del+Almendro,+13,+28005,+Madrid,+Madrid,+Madrid,+Spain&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;hl=en&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=48.106236,82.265625&#038;z=16&#038;om=1&#038;iwloc=addr">Map</a>). Even for people really into Spanish food, the native Madrileño cuisine is often not the most rousing experience. Forget that here. This place only does a few things, but they are done exceedingly well. The roscas and huevos rotos are satisfyingly solid, but also have a rustic flair that seems constantly ahead of the curve on avante garde cuisine. The decor is the madrid taberna of Anglo-American imagination. A tasca in a smart suit. It features a vaulted basement dining room from before the epoch of Goya, and the building itself abuts the old 12th-century city wall, traces of which are to be seen in the courtyard alongside the taberna. Oh, and the price defies expectation. I defy you to find a more fully satisfying dining experience in Madrid for the money. Oh, and the house <em>Manzanilla</em> is fantastic as well.</p></blockquote>
<p>Have you got a Madrid favourite you can <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/send-us-a-tip/">write in and tell us about</a>?</p>

<p>¡Toma Jamon!, the name of this favourite in La Latina, means &#8216;Eat Ham&#8217;. And that is exactly what I do when I&#8217;m there, from the moment I get through the door, until the bottle of wine is finished and we head on elsewhere. Ask for the house Crianza, I think it&#8217;s Rioja, but who cares &#8211; it&#8217;s delicious, and in any case, we are here for the ham! A plate costs 12 Euros and comes with a large helping of thick, tomato and oil covered bread &#8211; it&#8217;s ridiculous value for stuff this good.</p>
<p>I was shocked on my last visit to discover that this is one of <a href="http://www.tomajamon.com/plano.htm">a chain of 5</a> other ¡Toma Jamon! bars &#8211; you would never guess, it feels like a run-of-the-mill <em>Madrileño</em> bar. In any case, I shall never set foot in any of the others. This one is tucked away on Calle Mediodía Grande (no. 6 &#8211; <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=mediodia+grande+6,+madrid&#038;sll=37.181316,-3.593383&#038;sspn=0.011181,0.020084&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;z=17&#038;ll=40.409983,-3.710729&#038;spn=0.005343,0.013561&#038;om=1&#038;iwloc=addr">map</a>), in the back streets of my favourite late-night Barrio, and, what&#8217;s more, Princess Leticia&#8217;s dad used to drink here&#8230;<br />
(&#8230;before they stopped him drinking in public <img src='http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />  )</p>
