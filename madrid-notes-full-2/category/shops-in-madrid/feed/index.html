			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img id="image225" src="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/wp-content/uploads/organillorastro200.jpg" alt="organillorastro.jpg" align="left" />This famous Sunday morning flea market, located next to <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/category/by-barrio/la-latina/">La Latina</a>, one of the oldest quarters of Madrid, has everything from clothes, bags and other paraphernalia, to the funny stalls dedicated to just one single thing: there is one, for example, that sells nothing but various shapes and sizes of elastic bands!</p>
<p>One specific side street is dedicated to pets, with real pet shops on either side of the road, and a few people outside selling their own puppies out of cardboard boxes and sports bags. The main street, c/ Ribera de Curtidores, is the place to head to if you’d like to see antique shops in Madrid, most of which open every day of the week.</p>
<p>There are two extra reasons for visiting the Rastro on a Sunday morning: the first is the live music, from the organ grinder playing Chotis, a popular music and dance from Madrid, to a complete Jazz band if you’re lucky.</p>
<p>The second reason is food: finish your Rastro visit with either the traditional bocadillo de calamares, a battered squid baguette sold in one of the many bars lining the main Rastro strip, or head towards the atmospheric heart of La Latina for lunch in one of the many tapas bars around Plaza de la Cebada and Cava Baja. </p>
<p>TIPS: Go early, from 9:30 to 10:30 a.m., to avoid the masses. Be careful with your wallet, camera and other possessions, as this is <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/2007/04/24/pickpockets-in-madrid-and-the-rastro/">a favourite spot for pickpockets</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Metro:</strong> La Latina / Tirso de Molina. The Rastro is on Calle Ribera de Curtidores and surrounds. See map below:<span id="more-223"></span></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img id="image199" src="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/wp-content/uploads/things-you-miss.jpg" alt="The Things You Miss" align= "right" />Spanish food is wonderful. Well, except for <strong><em>callos</em></strong> (tripe)! Which is what I think King Juan Carlos was actually complaining about. &#8220;<em>¿Por qué no tienen callos?</em>&#8221; is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3DPDKbRxio">what I am sure he was saying</a> as a comment on Señor Chavez’s hospitality. But we can’t all share regal tastes! And sometimes we British don’t always want to eat Spanish.</p>
<p>We may have lived here years, but some memories never leave us. Is it Marmite, Horlicks or HP Sauce you suddenly get the urge to taste again? How about some Branston Pickle? PG Tips? Maynards Wine gums? But you will search the shelves of <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/2007/10/18/food-shopping-madrid/">El Cortes Inglés</a> in vain. There are just some things you miss.</p>
<p>There is a solution. It’s a shop called, wait for it, … <a href="http://www.thethingsyoumiss.com/Index_files/v3_document.htm">The Things You Miss</a>.</p>
<p>Sitting on the corner of Calle Juan de Austria and Calle Raimundo Lulio, not far from the Plaza de Olavide, this tiny shop sells all those wonderful things you haven’t had for ages or pester friends and relatives to pack in their suitcases when they visit. It’s not quite Arkwright’s Emporium, and it’s not open all hours, just <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/2007/11/27/shopping-out-of-hours/">normal Madrid times</a>, but its shelves display not just longed for goodies, but also memories from that other life you once led. Golly, they even had Barret’s Sherbert Fountains!</p>
<p>And just to show how wonderful it really is, even the Spanish shop there!</p>
<p>(<em>Ed. note: And if what you&#8217;re craving is American products&#8211;from Reese&#8217;s to brown sugar to cake mixes and even bagels, head to <a href="http://www.theamericanstore.es/">The American Store</a> or <a href="http://www.tasteofamerica.es/">Taste of America</a>.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Metro</strong>: Bilbao, Iglesia, Quevedo <strong>Address</strong>: C/ Juan de Austria, 11 <strong>Phone</strong>: 91 447 0785 <strong>Hours</strong>: Monday-Friday 10:00-14:00 and 17:00-20:00; Saturday 10:00-14:00. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img id="image169" src="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/wp-content/uploads/lanas.jpg" alt="Lanas" align= "right" />Seeing as knitting is a <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/03/30/opinion/edcarol.php">current craze for young people</a>, I recently defied my non-crafty genes and picked up some needles. Knitting—known as <em>tejar</em> or <em>hacer punto</em> or just <em>punto</em> in Spanish—hasn&#8217;t exactly become hip in Madrid to the degree it has in other cities of the world, but there&#8217;s a decent selection of different yarn shops here, including some picturesque weigh-the-yarn places.</p>
<p>My favorite so far has been the small, historic <strong>Lanas Sixto</strong>, where the shop assistant was very helpful and I bought some <a href="http://www.katia.es/index.php">Katia</a> yarn (a Spanish brand). I&#8217;ve been knitting even on the metro—talk about funny looks and comments—and the yarn&#8217;s now a scarf in progress. (<em>Lana</em> refers to yarn, even non-wool varieties.)</p>
<p>In the map below, I&#8217;ve tried to compile an exhaustive list of city yarn stores and you can view details for each. (If you have others to add or update, add your comment below).</p>
<p>To my knowledge, three shops offer weekly mixed level classes for €60-70 a month: at <strong>Inke</strong>, mornings and afternoons on various weekdays, at <strong>Lanas Alondra</strong> (Príncipe de Vergara location), 11:00-13:00 Wednesdays, and at <strong>Punto y Seguido</strong>, 18:00-20:00 Fridays.</p>
<p>For community, there&#8217;s the monthly get-together or <em>tertulia</em> of expat and <em>madrileña</em> knitters at the grand Círculo de Bellas Artes café (€1 entrance). The meet-up is usually every third Thursday; see their <a href="http://quedadas.blogsome.com/">blog</a> for more information.</p>
<p>See map below for yarn stores: <span id="more-167"></span></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img id="image160" src="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/wp-content/uploads/bacchus-bar.jpg" alt="Bacchus Bar and Bookshop" align="right" />If you didn’t bother bringing your whole library with you to Madrid, have no fear. Madrid is home to several quality second-hand English bookshops for all your literary needs. The story doesn’t end at books, either: you can take advantage of <strong>free WiFi</strong>, <em>intercambio</em> and quiz nights, and liquid refreshment, too. And when you finish your books, you can always sell them back.<br />
<strong><br />
Petra’s International Bookshop</strong> is a cozy spot with floor to ceiling bookshelves filled with books in all subject areas and many languages (beyond the usual suspects of English, French, and German to Russian, Chinese, and Japanese). Petra’s has a great selection (perhaps the best of the bunch) and offers complimentary coffee and tea to its patrons as well. </p>
<p><strong>Metro</strong>: Ópera, Santo Domingo <strong>Address</strong>: C/ Campomanes, 13 <strong>Phone</strong>: 91 541 72 91 <strong>Hours</strong>: 11:00-21:00, closed Sundays.</p>
<p><strong>J &#038; J Books and Coffee</strong> is practically an institution in this city, not only for its books, but for its nightly events that nearly always draw a big crowd of expats and English-hungry Spaniards. Tuesdays are teachers’ nights with discounts on teaching materials, Wednesday and Thursday nights are for <em>intercambios</em> (Thursday is more popular), Friday nights there’s a pub quiz at 11, and Saturday nights are all you can drink for 12 euros (beer on tap and wine). There’s free WiFi too.</p>
<p><strong>Metro</strong>: Noviciado <strong>Address</strong>: C/ Espíritu Santo, 47 <strong>Phone</strong>: 91 521 85 76 <strong>Hours</strong>: Monday-Thursday 11:00-24:00; Friday and Saturday 11:00-2:30; Sunday 16:00-22:00.<br />
<strong><br />
Bacchus Bar and Bookshop</strong> is the newcomer to the bunch and is positioned perfectly in a student-heavy neighborhood. In the style of J &#038; J, it has a bar, plenty of books, WiFi, and nightly events. Mondays from 8 to 9 there’s a <em>tertulia</em> (get-together) in English for the non-native speakers out there, Tuesdays there’s an <em>intercambio</em> at 8 with happy hour the two hours before (to get you loosened up, one would suppose?). And their quiz night is Wednesday at 9.</p>
<p><strong>Metro</strong>: Moncloa, Argüelles <strong>Address</strong>: C/ Meléndez Valdés, 52 <strong>Phone</strong>: 91 544 73 78 <strong>Hours</strong>: 17:00-1:00 (24:00 midweek), Sunday 11:00-1:00.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img id="image157" src="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/wp-content/uploads/clothes.jpg" alt="Clothes" align= "right" />Second-hand shopping is a fun pastime in any city and Madrid is no exception. Now the prices are nowhere near the rock-bottom steals I&#8217;ve found in cities in the U.S., but sometimes prices here are negotiable. Here are five shops to check out:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Underground</strong>: This place is packed with clothes from the &#8217;50s to the 90&#8242;s, and I mean packed. Peek into the back room and you&#8217;ll see bags and bags of more pieces. Perhaps they have underground storage too?</p>
<p>2. <strong>Holala</strong>: This <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/category/by-barrio/malasana/">Malasaña</a> shop&#8217;s an eclectic mix of used clothing and the quirky new things by <a href="http://www.zombiestudio.es/">Zombie Studio</a>. Take a romp through these retro designs.</p>
<p>3. <a href="http://www.humana-spain.org/TextPage.asp?MenuItemID=73&#038;SubMenuItemID=148">Humana</a>: This is the most reminiscent of Goodwill stores, in that their purpose is humanitarian and recycling. Their five Madrid locations offer a little of everything at low prices.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Corachón y Delgado</strong>: This is an upscale vintage boutique with plenty of accessories and designer clothing.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Lotta</strong>: Another nicer vintage shop worth browsing with hand-picked name brands, lots of dresses.</p>
<p><em>What other places do you know of in Madrid to buy unique vintage (or vintage-style) clothing?</em></p>
<p>See map below for addresses of all stores mentioned above: <span id="more-155"></span></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Spanish friend of mine calls herself a vegetarian. But, she says, “I make an exception for jamón.” There you have it: it can be a little tough to be a true vegetarian in this country. </p>
<p>In Madrid, though, life is not so bad for those who seek vegetarian-friendly shops or restaurants. First, you&#8217;ve got <a href="http://www.naturasi.es/index.html"><strong>NaturaSí</strong></a>, an Italian natural foods supermarket chain with <a href="http://www.naturasi.es/venta.html">three locations in Madrid</a>. I buy everything from oats and organic chocolate to tofu and tamari here. Another of the biggies is <a href="http://ecocentro.es/index2.htm"><strong>Ecocentro</strong></a>—a natural foods “center.” In addition to the  <a href="http://ecocentro.es/multitienda.htm" supermarket, which is comparable to NaturaSí, there's a vegetarian <a href="http://ecocentro.es/restaurante.htm">restaurant</a> with many appetizing options. Finally, in <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/category/by-barrio/lavapies/">Lavapiés</a>, you’ve got <a href="http://www.asaltodemata.org/index3.html"><strong>A salto de mata</strong></a>, which is a smaller natural foods store with a serious focus on buying its products locally.</p>
<p>Among the many vegetarian dining options in the city, the organic market and buffet <strong>Viva la Vida</strong> is excellent for a quick meal. Conveniently located on Calle Huertas, it offers a mouth-watering buffet for 1.80 euros per 100 grams. Make sure to save room for a piece of carrot cake after your meal. <strong>El Granero de Lavapiés</strong>, on Calle Argumosa, also deserves a mention for its delicious home-cooked, and mostly organic vegetarian food. You’ll feel like you’re at home too, in their welcoming dining room.</p>

<p>The holidays are upon us and it’s time to decorate your <em>piso</em>.  Christmas trees, holiday lights, nativity scene figurines.  Where in Madrid can you shop for decorations?</p>
<p>In a word – Plaza Mayor.  The scene of a traditional, frenetic holiday market, the various stalls of the plaza offer all of the above and more.  You’ll find entire stalls dedicated to the nativity scene and its players; the creation of a <em>belen</em> in Spain is clearly a labor of love.  Detailed baby Jesus can set you back 100€ while smaller, less-important figures are available starting around 9€; stables run well into the hundreds.  At the other stalls you’ll find artificial trees (ranging in height from one to ten feet), strings of lights, stockings, and poinsettias.</p>
<p>Although you can also certainly pick up your Christmas tree in the plaza, why not do something good for the world at the same time?  Stop over at the <a href="http://www.montes.upm.es/temporales/abetos/index.html">Environmental Sciences School</a> in Ciudad Universitaria where they offer potted holiday trees for “rent.”  Pick out yours (free delivery for those measuring over 1.25m), dress it up for a few weeks, and once the holidays have passed return the tree to the school.  They’ll then plant the tree in their own gardens or out in the wilderness surrounding Madrid.  Trees start at 20€ and top-out at 160€ for a 12-foot monster.</p>
<p><strong>Happy holidays and happy shopping!</strong></p>

<p>We’ve covered the bases for you on <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/category/living-in-madrid/">food shopping</a>, but with what equipment are you going to prepare and serve all that lovely food you’ve just bought? There are, of course, many places to buy kitchenware in this town (from your neighborhood “Euro Bazaar” on up the scale). But if you’re looking for high-quality, hard-to-find, or professional materials plus incredibly knowledgeable staff, head over to <a href="http://www.alambique.com/plt_Home.aspx?ChangeLanguage=2">Alambique</a>. </p>
<p>Alambique is home to everything from knives and whisks to pots, pans, and ice cream makers, but what really sets it above the rest is that it offers <a href="http://www.alambique.com/plt_CourseCategory.aspx?IdObjeto=1">cooking classes</a> of all kinds—right in the store. Among the classes at the school this fall were “Sushi and Sashimi,” a class on cooking with garbanzos (chickpeas), another on knives, as well as series of classes for beginning cooks and those with a little more experience. And that’s only the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>Most classes are two-and-a-half hours long. Prices range from about 40 to 90 euros. </p>
<p>Metro: Opera or Santo Domingo. Plaza de la Encarnación, 2. Phone: 91 559 7858 / 91 547 4220. See map below: <span id="more-117"></span></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/wp-content/uploads/closed.jpg" alt="Typical Madrid opening hours" align="left" />The scene – or variations thereof – will be familiar to many a non-native <em>Madrileño</em>. Late for a meeting yesterday, I realised I&#8217;d run out of deodorant. Horror struck. Not because I&#8217;m afflicted with particularly bad BO (to my knowledge), but because it was just past 2:30pm, the time when almost everything becomes unavailable, almost everywhere.</p>
<p>As you might expect, the exceptions tend to be the big players. If you feel <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/2007/10/21/avoid-el-corte-ingles/">like I do</a> about El Corte Inglés, your options are largely limited to specialist chains. Supermarkets <a href="http://www.carrefour.es/supermercados/guia_supermercados/index.html">Carrefour</a> and <a href="http://www.mercadona.es/corp/esp-html/donde.html">Mercadona</a> are fairly ubiquitous. They ensure you won&#8217;t go hungry (or smelly), but not much beyond that. For clothes, gifts and electrical goods, the shops around Sol – such as <a href="http://www.fnac.es/">Fnac</a> (books/music/technology), <a href="http://www.zara.es/">Zara</a> (fashion) and Vodafone (mobile phones) – have generally civilised opening times. </p>
<p>Last, but not least, Chinese-owned shops do a sterling job of providing most things around the clock. Although quality is variable, a discerning eye can land you a bargain in your lunch hour. I recently bought a good Spanish-made espresso maker at my local <em>chino</em> for the price of two coffees.</p>
<p>As for the deodorant, I eventually found it in the Quevedo branch of Gilgo.</p>

<p>The mindless <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/2007/01/22/graffiti-in-madrid-what-are-they-going-to-do-about-it/">graffiti</a> and affable goths seem a lukewarm legacy of <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Movida_Madrile%C3%B1a">La Movida Madrileña</a></em> (the capital&#8217;s post-Franco wild years) which kicked off in Malasaña in the Seventies. However, some of Spain&#8217;s cultural revolutionaries (the ones who didn&#8217;t die of heroine overdoses) are still to be spotted slinking around the <em>barrio</em>, ensuring that the party spirit lives on. Meanwhile, gentrification has led to some great shopping and eating options.</p>
<p><strong>Drinking</strong>: In summer, the Plaza Dos de Mayo is the perfect spot for a caña. In colder weather, try the bars in its vicinity, such as El Maño (C/ Palma 64), which serves good wine in art(y) deco surroundings. For those craving a taste of the Malasaña celebrated in Almodóvar&#8217;s early films, La Vía Láctea (C/ Velarde 18) provides a dose of historical hedonism. </p>
<p><strong>Eating</strong>: Tasty modern tapas can be gorged at a decent price at <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/2007/10/14/ojala-best-secret-lunch-madrid/">Ojalá</a>; but the barrio also boasts some fine international restaurants, such as La Granja de Said  (Moroccan; C/ San Andrés 11), La Catrina (Mexican; C/ Corredera Alta de San Pablo 13), <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/2007/10/31/xin-pan-asian-food-madrid/">Xin</a> (Asian), and Palermo Viejo (Argentinean; C/ San Joaquín 5).</p>
<p><strong>Shopping</strong>: One of Malasaña&#8217;s main arteries, C/ Corredera Alta de San Pablo heaves with everything from wool (at no. 12) to state-of-the-art trainers (Tabula Rasa, at no. 33); while on nearby streets, quirky boutiques like <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/2007/11/06/ioli-stride-in-style/">Ioli</a> (bespoke shoes) and Corachan y Delgado (vintage designer clothes; C/ Valverde 42) are popping up all the time. C/ Manuela Malasaña is great for gifts, and C/ Palma is the street for record shopping.</p>
