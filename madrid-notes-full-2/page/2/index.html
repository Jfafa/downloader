<p>There are few things more <em>castizo</em>—authentic—in this city than a breakfast of <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/2007/10/19/great-madrid-traditions-chocolateria-san-gines/"><em>chocolate con churros</em></a>. Though these fried delights are a staple at neighborhood bars around Madrid, they are rarely made in the bar itself. Instead, bars depend on regular deliveries from the diminishing number of <em>churrerías</em> around the city for their supply. </p>
<p>According to Antonio, one of my neighborhood <em>churreros</em>, the number of these tiny fried dough factories has dropped from 1,600 to less than 200 in the last 15 years. And that’s because the <em>churreros</em> are a dying breed. Of the four <em>churrerías</em> that operate in my barrio, most of the <em>churreros</em> are over 70. Antonio, who is a sprightly 35, is already training one of his delivery guys in the art of <em>churro</em>-making. He himself started 18 years ago. He says it was just like becoming a mechanic or a plumber: a vocation. </p>
<p>His bright little <em>churrería</em>, a relative newbie in the barrio (it’s been around for 10 years) shows no sign of slowing down. But, as Antonio says, it’s “slave” work: the hours are grueling (he opens from 5 to 11 am every day, holidays included). In another miniscule old-timey <em>churrería</em> two blocks from my house, the older woman who runs it with her husband refused to even answer my questions because she was too exhausted and busy. She said she’d been up since 2 am.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s clear, though, that the <em>madrileño</em> love for fried dough hasn&#8217;t wavered. Even Antonio says he still swears by a <em>desayuno con churros</em>.</p>

<div class="contenttext">
<p><img id="image184" src="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/wp-content/uploads/menuboard.jpg" alt="Menú del Día" align= "left" />It’s common for Spanish workers to take a lunch break in the middle of their working day. The usual thing is to go out to a restaurant and have a <em>menú del día</em>, menu of the day. This set lunch consists of a starter, a second course, and a dessert, with several options for each, at a fair price &#8212; from 9 euros depending on the restaurant. The price also includes bread and a drink &#8212; water, soft drinks, wine or beer. You’ll find <em>menus del día</em> in a good portion of Spanish restaurants from Monday to Friday at lunch time &#8212; between about 1 pm and 3.30 pm. Check near the door of the restaurant or on a board outside for options for that particular day.</p>
<p>There are several dishes which are likely to be found in a <em>menú del día</em> on a particular day. For example, on Thursday paella is usually one of the options, and in Madrid, Tuesday is the day to have <em>cocido</em> (hearty chickpea and meat stew).</p>
<p>There are several urban legends as to why Thursdays are the official paella day. One is that Franco used to go hunting on Thursdays, and when he did, he liked to eat paella. As his hunting destination was always unknown, every restaurant in the country had to be prepared in case he appeared and demanded his favourite food. Others say that since maids used to have Thursdays off, they would leave the first step of the paella recipe, <em>el sofrito</em> (everything but the rice!), cooked on Wednesday night, ready for the lady of the house to add the rice in time for Thursday lunch.</p>
<p>So, venture out into the city and let us know what your favorite <em>menú</em> is! Here are some of <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/category/madrid-restaurants/lunch/">our favorites</a> to get you started.</p>

<div class="contenttext">
<p><img src="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/wp-content/uploads/sushi.jpg" alt="" align="left" />I hate Sushi. My wife knows this, so she had to lie to get me here. Well, maybe not lie, but certainly not reveal our exact location until it was way too late to change the arrangements with friends.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t happy. Tricked into going to a restaurant where they only eat raw fish and seaweed. That&#8217;s low.</p>
<p>Then suddenly I was handed the menu. It had chicken on it! And noodles with vegetables! And more chicken! And looking around, I realised that I was amongst Madrid&#8217;s elusive <em>Beautiful People</em>. All, it seemed, was not lost.</p>
<p>So hurray for the weirdly named <a href="http://pinksushiman.com/">Pink Sushi Man</a>, where difficult people like me can still walk out feeling satisfied, where the crispy chicken is divine, the noodles are delicious, and the psychedelic decor is as far as you can possibly get from your average Madrid bar.</p>
<p>Highly recommended for a change of scene.</p>
<p>The lunchtime ten Euro <em>menu del dia</em> gets you 5 plates of allegedly very good sushi (or nice cooked food that never saw the ocean floor!) Come very early (by 1.45 for lunch), or risk a long queue.</p>

<div class="contenttext">
<p><em>Madrileños</em>, to an only slightly lesser degree than their compatriots, can display a frustrating tendency to act like sheep in their daily lives. <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/2007/11/27/shopping-out-of-hours/">Very few shops</a> open between 14:30 and 17:00; and if you need/want to lunch before 13:30 or after 16:00, you&#8217;re pretty much limited to McDonald&#8217;s. There are some exceptions, however.</p>
<p>If you can get hold of it, <em>On Madrid</em>, the entertainment supplement that comes with Friday&#8217;s <em>El País</em>, has a little section (within its restaurant section) listing late dining options. Beware, though, as some of these turn out to be false. Best to phone ahead.</p>
<p>Here are the places I know to have extended opening times:</p>
<p>•    <strong>Pub &#8220;Red&#8221;</strong> (C/ San Vicente Ferrer, 20, Metro Tribunal) &#8211; Fresh, unpretentious food (hamburgers and <em>platos combinados</em>) in a haunt of football fanatics. Open until about 2am.</p>
<p>•    <strong>Hard Rock Café</strong> (Pº Castellana, 2, Metro Colón) – Decent, not especially cheap, diner-style food in a haunt of rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll fanatics. Open all day &#8221;til late&#8217;.</p>
<p>•    <strong>Iberia</strong> (Glorieta Ruiz Jimenez, Metro San Bernardo) – A favourite with taxi drivers, who stop for sandwiches at all hours of the night. Good for emergencies.<br />
<em><br />
Any more suggestions?</em></p>

<p>Madrid is known for its sunny, chattering <em>terrazas</em>—open patios that cafés typically operate April through October.</p>
<p>Even more special are rooftop <em>terrazas</em>. Madrid has no skyline to speak of, but its buildings are still tall enough to hide you from the stares of passers-by and give you a unique view of the city.</p>
<p>Here, then, are my favorite <em>terrazas</em> with day or nighttime views:</p>
<p>1. <a href="http://www.gaudeamuscafe.com/">Gaudeamus Café</a>: Atop the church-turned-UNED building in <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/category/by-barrio/lavapies/">Lavapiés</a>, this place has a chill atmosphere and is the perfect place to share a drink or light lunch with friends.</p>
<p>2. <a href="http://www.lacasaencendida.com/LCE/lceCruce">La Casa Encendida</a>: We&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/index.php?s=casa+encendida">mentioned</a> this art space&#8217;s rooftop before, and granted, while there&#8217;s no food for sale, you could reasonably try to bring a solidarity picnic or at least go to <em>tomar el sol</em>.</p>
<p>3. <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/2007/01/23/shhh-dont-tell-anyone-else-about-casa-de-granada/">Casa Granada</a>: Its views rank well above its menu. Marina recommends arriving before sunset to get both the before and after vistas.</p>
<p>Downtown <a href="http://www.derbyhotels.es/page.php?id=517">Hotel Urban</a> (La Terraza del Urban), <a href="http://www.hoteldelasletras.com/">Hotel de las Letras</a> (Ático de Letras), and <a href="http://www.hoteles-silken.com/HPAM/index.php">Hotel Puerta América</a> (Sky Night) all offer swank rooftop bars—think cool jazz and cocktails—but I readily admit I&#8217;ve not yet visited any of them. Too high (class) for me. But perhaps you&#8217;ll find a special occasion that warrants a visit. Remember, you&#8217;re paying for the view.<br />
<em><br />
(Ed. note: The above photo is the view of <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/category/by-barrio/la-latina/">La Latina</a> from another venerable rooftop in Madrid, <a href="http://11870.com/pro/18511">El Viajero</a>.)</em></p>
<p>Do you know of anywhere else to get a view with your drink or meal?</p>

<p><em>by Amy Menchhofer</em></p>
<div class="contenttext">
<p>So you’ve got an <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/2008/03/05/how-to-get-an-intercambio-in-madrid/"><em>intercambio</em></a>. Now what? Ideally an <em>intercambio</em> is about fun and learning and perfecting another language. But the first couple times will perhaps feel like something between a job interview and a first date. Keep these tips in mind to make sure things flow smoothly. </p>
<p>1. <strong>Pick a good place</strong>. Hopping <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/category/bars/">bars</a>, sidewalk terraces, busy <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/category/madrid-parks/">parks</a> – places primed for people-watching provide an endless supply of conversation topics to get the ball rolling.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Be on time and wear something bright</strong>.  Meeting in a public place with someone that you’ve never even seen before is mildly nerve-wracking. Make it easier on the other person by wearing <em>algo llamativo</em> (something attention-getting).</p>
<p>3. <strong>Don’t be shy</strong>. Striking up conversation with a total stranger can be somewhat daunting. Chalk it up to a good experience and jump in with both feet.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Don’t talk too much</strong>.  Hint: <em>Intercambio</em> means interchange. </p>
<p>5. <strong>Don’t be too nice</strong>. Correcting someone else’s speech doesn’t always come easily (unless you were born with the teacher gene). But if you don’t do it then there’s really not much point to the whole get-together.  You’re both there to improve so don’t take offense and don’t keep quiet.</p>

<div class="contenttext">
<p>If you&#8217;re not too fussed about staying in a hotel, Madrid&#8217;s <em>hostales</em> are often homier and better value. Generally speaking, these are clean and friendly places with basic amenities and the price to match. What could be better than having more of your budget to spend on eating, drinking, and sightseeing in this fantastic city?</p>
<p>We who live in Madrid are, of course, not the experts on places to stay. I&#8217;ve taken a place that I know plus other personal recommendations to make this list. I&#8217;ll leave the rest up to you in the comments.</p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.ihostales.com/english/ficha.php?id=35">Hostal Angelines</a>: small and family-run with just six rooms. Very close to Moncloa and the University, putting you in a residential neighborhood that&#8217;s close walking distance to the true center of the city. A single or double will set you back only 40 euros or 45 euros a night, respectively.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.hostalmarialuisa.com/">Hostal María Luisa</a>: similar to the one above with the main difference being that it&#8217;s in <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/category/by-barrio/chueca/">Chueca</a>, i.e. a very happening place to be. Just <a href="http://www.hostalmarialuisa.com/Ehabitaciones.html">a little more expensive</a> than Angelines.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.hostalcruzsol.com/">Hostal Cruz Sol</a> and <a href="http://www.hostalsantacruz.com/ingles/index.html">Hostal Santa Cruz</a> are both recommended by Gary from over at the Notes from Spain forum. They&#8217;re in the same building set on a plaza just steps from <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/2007/10/05/avoid-eating-in-the-plaza-mayor/">Plaza Mayor</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m going to leave you with a <a href="http://travelqa.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/05/madrid-hostals-as-an-alternative-to-hotels/">great travel Q&#038;A</a> on the subject from the <em>New York Times</em> that gives several more worthwhile recommendations.	</p>

<p><img id="image169" src="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/wp-content/uploads/lanas.jpg" alt="Lanas" align= "right" />Seeing as knitting is a <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/03/30/opinion/edcarol.php">current craze for young people</a>, I recently defied my non-crafty genes and picked up some needles. Knitting—known as <em>tejar</em> or <em>hacer punto</em> or just <em>punto</em> in Spanish—hasn&#8217;t exactly become hip in Madrid to the degree it has in other cities of the world, but there&#8217;s a decent selection of different yarn shops here, including some picturesque weigh-the-yarn places.</p>
<p>My favorite so far has been the small, historic <strong>Lanas Sixto</strong>, where the shop assistant was very helpful and I bought some <a href="http://www.katia.es/index.php">Katia</a> yarn (a Spanish brand). I&#8217;ve been knitting even on the metro—talk about funny looks and comments—and the yarn&#8217;s now a scarf in progress. (<em>Lana</em> refers to yarn, even non-wool varieties.)</p>
<p>In the map below, I&#8217;ve tried to compile an exhaustive list of city yarn stores and you can view details for each. (If you have others to add or update, add your comment below).</p>
<p>To my knowledge, three shops offer weekly mixed level classes for €60-70 a month: at <strong>Inke</strong>, mornings and afternoons on various weekdays, at <strong>Lanas Alondra</strong> (Príncipe de Vergara location), 11:00-13:00 Wednesdays, and at <strong>Punto y Seguido</strong>, 18:00-20:00 Fridays.</p>
<p>For community, there&#8217;s the monthly get-together or <em>tertulia</em> of expat and <em>madrileña</em> knitters at the grand Círculo de Bellas Artes café (€1 entrance). The meet-up is usually every third Thursday; see their <a href="http://quedadas.blogsome.com/">blog</a> for more information.</p>

<div class="contenttext">
<p>Whether you’re looking for a new friend or just good conversation, the <em>intercambio</em> is one of the most useful tools to help the expat assimilate to his new home (or to help any local to get away from it all). Luckily, it’s also a million times easier than <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/2008/02/20/how-to-find-a-room-in-madrid/">finding an apartment</a>. But where to start?</p>
<p>Check out local expat papers like <a href="http://www.in-madrid.com/">In Madrid</a>, look into the various language nights offered throughout the city. Located in bars and <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/2008/02/26/where-to-buy-and-sell-second-hand-books-in-madrid/">bookshops</a> and typically starting after dinner, they are the perfect chance to meet a conversation partner. (See details below.)</p>
<p>Remember also that <em>intercambios</em> are like doctors &#8212; you can find a really good one by referral.  So ask around &#8212; at your language school, at the gym, among your friends, and their friends, and their friends’ friends. The <em>intercambio</em> “market” is ever increasing and within those seven degrees of separation you’ll certainly find a willing candidate.  <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/2008/03/05/how-to-get-an-intercambio-in-madrid/#more-165" class="more-link">Read more &raquo;</a></p>

<p><img id="image160" src="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/wp-content/uploads/bacchus-bar.jpg" alt="Bacchus Bar and Bookshop" align="right" />If you didn’t bother bringing your whole library with you to Madrid, have no fear. Madrid is home to several quality second-hand English bookshops for all your literary needs. The story doesn’t end at books, either: you can take advantage of <strong>free WiFi</strong>, <em>intercambio</em> and quiz nights, and liquid refreshment, too. And when you finish your books, you can always sell them back.<br />
<strong><br />
Petra’s International Bookshop</strong> is a cozy spot with floor to ceiling bookshelves filled with books in all subject areas and many languages (beyond the usual suspects of English, French, and German to Russian, Chinese, and Japanese). Petra’s has a great selection (perhaps the best of the bunch) and offers complimentary coffee and tea to its patrons as well. </p>
<p><strong>Metro</strong>: Ópera, Santo Domingo <strong>Address</strong>: C/ Campomanes, 13 <strong>Phone</strong>: 91 541 72 91 <strong>Hours</strong>: 11:00-21:00, closed Sundays.</p>
<p><strong>J &#038; J Books and Coffee</strong> is practically an institution in this city, not only for its books, but for its nightly events that nearly always draw a big crowd of expats and English-hungry Spaniards. Tuesdays are teachers’ nights with discounts on teaching materials, Wednesday and Thursday nights are for <em>intercambios</em> (Thursday is more popular), Friday nights there’s a pub quiz at 11, and Saturday nights are all you can drink for 12 euros (beer on tap and wine). There’s free WiFi too.</p>
<p><strong>Metro</strong>: Noviciado <strong>Address</strong>: C/ Espíritu Santo, 47 <strong>Phone</strong>: 91 521 85 76 <strong>Hours</strong>: Monday-Thursday 11:00-24:00; Friday and Saturday 11:00-2:30; Sunday 16:00-22:00.<br />
<strong><br />
Bacchus Bar and Bookshop</strong> is the newcomer to the bunch and is positioned perfectly in a student-heavy neighborhood. In the style of J &#038; J, it has a bar, plenty of books, WiFi, and nightly events. Mondays from 8 to 9 there’s a <em>tertulia</em> (get-together) in English for the non-native speakers out there, Tuesdays there’s an <em>intercambio</em> at 8 with happy hour the two hours before (to get you loosened up, one would suppose?). And their quiz night is Wednesday at 9.</p>
<p><strong>Metro</strong>: Moncloa, Argüelles <strong>Address</strong>: C/ Meléndez Valdés, 52 <strong>Phone</strong>: 91 544 73 78 <strong>Hours</strong>: 17:00-1:00 (24:00 midweek), Sunday 11:00-1:00.</p>

<p><em>by Niels Klok</em></p>
<div class="contenttext">
<p>Madrid being the capital of one of Europe’s most popular Mediterranean countries, it will not come as a surprise that housing its four million or so inhabitants is (to put it mildly) an issue of concern. The city rivals its sisters in Northern Europe in price; and with wages often being twice as low as “up North”, problems are bound to arise. As such, Madrid has taken the phenomenon of sharing an apartment to a whole different level: no longer simply a student affair, you may find yourself living with <em>madrileños</em> of all ages and occupations, couples included. Check your cupboards, you might find another flatmate in there.</p>
<p>Most newly arrived will not have the means to rent (let alone <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/2008/02/11/how-to-buy-a-flat-in-madrid/">buy</a>!) a place by themselves, and are consequently thrown into the madness of a market that is ruled by “castings” in <em>pisos</em> (apartments) of varying merit. How to become one of the lucky ones? The Internet, as is so often the case, is where it all happens:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.segundamano.es">www.segundamano.es</a> is a popular place to look, even though the number of rooms advertised is significantly low these days. Select Madrid, then <em>Pisos</em> from the drop-down menu, and mark <em>se alquila</em> before clicking <em>Busca</em> to check what’s on offer. Rumor has it that the print version of Segunda Mano (available at newsstands) has more rooms, which are not advertised on the web.
	</li>
<li><a href="http://www.pisocompartido.com">www.pisocompartido.com</a> has less visibility but can act as an additional resource. Select <em>Busco habitación en alquiler</em> and MADRID from the drop-down menus.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.idealista.com">www.idealista.com</a> has more search options than the others (smoking vs. non-smoking etc.) and you can select your area by navigating a map of Madrid. Do check the date of posting, however: ads are rarely removed. Start by selecting <em>alquilar</em>, <em>habitación</em> and Madrid from the menus on the main page.  <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/2008/02/20/how-to-find-a-room-in-madrid/#more-158" class="more-link">Read more &raquo;</a></li>

<p><em>by Marina Diez</em></p>
<div class="contenttext">
<p><img src="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/wp-content/uploads/fabada.jpg" alt="fabada" /></p>
<p>When it’s cold in Madrid, nothing revives you like a good Fabada, the thick Asturian bean stew with chorizo, ham and morcilla (black pudding).  Here are my three favourite Asturian restaurants to sample a great Fabada, as well as other Asturian delights:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.casa-portal.com">Casa Portal</a>:<br />
This is a friendly and traditional restaurant, not far from the Retiro park. For an informal meal or great tapas, the tables located near the bar are fine. For a relaxed full lunch head further inside to the dinning area located beyond the end of the bar. As well as the Fabada, try the assorted Asturian Cheese plate, croquetas made of vegtables or a strong blue cheese called Cabrales, and the Asturian Omelette with white tuna, onion and tomato.</p>
<p><strong>Metro</strong>: Ibiza, Goya, O’Donell <strong>Address</strong>: C/ Doctor Castelo, 26 <strong>Phone</strong>: 91 574 2026 <strong>Opening hours</strong>: 13:30-16:30 and 20:30-23:30. Closed Sunday night and all day Monday.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.infonegocio.com/casturmadrid/casahortensia/home.htm">Casa Hortensia</a>:<br />
Formely located in a tiny restaurant in Lavapies, Casa Hortensia recently moved to a much bigger location on the second floor of the “Centro Asturiano” building just off Calle Fuencarral. They have two sittings for lunch, at 1:30 and 3 pm, and it’s essential to book. It’s really important to note that one portion of Fabada easily feeds two, so one Fabada, a Salad and another starter would be a great choice for two people &#8211; the same applies to Casa Portal.</p>
<p><strong>Metro</strong>: Tribunal, Chueca <strong>Address</strong>: C/ Farmacia, 2 2º <strong>Phone</strong>: 91 5390090 <strong>Opening hours</strong>: 13:30-16:30 and 20:30-24:00. Closed Sunday night and all day Monday.</p>
<p><strong>Casa Mingo</strong>:<br />
Famous city-wide for its roast chicken, both to eat in or take away, this traditional family restaurant has excellent service, and is even better value than the two places mentioned above. Although the Fabada portion is smaller (and cheaper) here, Casa Mingo is always worth a visit for its great food and wonderful atmosphere.</p>
<p><strong>Metro</strong>: Principe Pio <strong>Address</strong>: Paseo de la Florida, 34 <strong>Phone</strong>: 91 5477918 <strong>Opening hours</strong>: 11-24h.</p>
<p>See map below for restaurant locations:  <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/2008/02/18/where-to-eat-a-good-fabada-in-madrid/#more-154" class="more-link">Read more &raquo;</a></p>

<div class="contenttext">
<p><img id="image157" src="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/wp-content/uploads/clothes.jpg" alt="Clothes" align= "right" />Second-hand shopping is a fun pastime in any city and Madrid is no exception. Now the prices are nowhere near the rock-bottom steals I&#8217;ve found in cities in the U.S., but sometimes prices here are negotiable. Here are five shops to check out:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Underground</strong>: This place is packed with clothes from the &#8217;50s to the 90&#8242;s, and I mean packed. Peek into the back room and you&#8217;ll see bags and bags of more pieces. Perhaps they have underground storage too?</p>
<p>2. <strong>Holala</strong>: This <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/category/by-barrio/malasana/">Malasaña</a> shop&#8217;s an eclectic mix of used clothing and the quirky new things by <a href="http://www.zombiestudio.es/">Zombie Studio</a>. Take a romp through these retro designs.</p>
<p>3. <a href="http://www.humana-spain.org/TextPage.asp?MenuItemID=73&#038;SubMenuItemID=148">Humana</a>: This is the most reminiscent of Goodwill stores, in that their purpose is humanitarian and recycling. Their five Madrid locations offer a little of everything at low prices.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Corachón y Delgado</strong>: This is an upscale vintage boutique with plenty of accessories and designer clothing.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Lotta</strong>: Another nicer vintage shop worth browsing with hand-picked name brands, lots of dresses.</p>
<p><em>What other places do you know of in Madrid to buy unique vintage (or vintage-style) clothing?</em></p>

<p><em>by Katie Goldstein</em></p>
<div class="contenttext">
<p><img id="image153" src="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/wp-content/uploads/la-latina.jpg" alt="La Latina" /></p>
<p>You can think of La Latina as <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/2007/11/15/madrid-lavapies-going-out-eating-drinking/">Lavapiés</a>’ more stylish older sister. The neighborhood is one of the most lively in Madrid thanks to the combination of a high concentration of good <em>tapas</em> bars and a young, modern crowd. And it’s happening at about any time of the week. Sundays may be La Latina’s busiest day, with the morning <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Rastro">Rastro</a> and the afternoon spillover into the bars and plazas of the <em>barrio</em>. Enter any bar at about 6 p.m. and it’ll feel like Saturday night all over again.</p>
<p>Ben has already made a fantastic <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/2007/04/24/la-latina-bars-some-of-our-favourites/">map</a> with some of his favorite bars, but here are a few more suggestions for Sundays and beyond:</p>
<p><strong>Drink:</strong> <strong>Taberna Salamanca</strong> is a tiny, old timey place on the famed Cava Baja good for a drink before heading elsewhere—the food is apparently worth it as well. <strong>Barrio Alto</strong> is a stylish yet laid-back bar that boasts cocktails and reasonably priced light meals set to jazz, funk, and more.</p>
<p><strong>Eat:</strong> <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/2007/02/01/taberna-del-almendro-from-michael-carlin/">Taberna El Almendro</a> deserves the first mention for the outstanding price-quality ratio and ambience to boot. <strong>Txakoli</strong> is an excellent Basque <em>pintxos</em> bar with two locations. <strong>Juana La Loca</strong> offers innovative <em>pintxos</em> in a sit-down setting. Some complain it’s overpriced, but it’s worth trying the <em>tortilla de patata</em> with caramelized onions. </p>
<p><strong>Picnic:</strong> Grab a <em>bocadillo</em> from the <strong>Cervecería San Andrés</strong> and join the multitudes sitting in the adjacent plaza on a sunny day at any time of year (see photo above!). You can also head down to the lovely Plaza de la Paja to hit up the brand new second location of <a href="http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/2007/12/26/natural-foods-in-madrid/">Viva la Vida</a>, the vegetarian take-away buffet, and eat outside.</p>
<p><strong>Debauch:</strong> One word: <a href="http://contraclub.com/">Contraclub</a>. <em>Copas</em> and great music: funk, soul, rock, etc. No <a href="http://www.los40.com/"><em>40 Principales</em></a> to be found here. Friday and Saturday it&#8217;s open ‘til 6 a.m., with free entry until 2 a.m.</p>
<p><em>What are your favorite spots in La Latina?</em></p>
