		<description>Today I walked by a used book store (seemed to be mostly books in Spanish) just south of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/2008/01/17/plaza-dos-de-mayo-the-real-thing/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Plaza 2 de Mayo&lt;/a&gt; in Malasaña (on C/ San Andrés)--it&#039;s called Arrebato Libros.</description>

		<description>Hi Alan,

Petra&#039;s sells used books in many languages, Spanish included, so definitely check it out. I have seen other used book stores, but sort of random ones in my neighborhood (the Moncloa area). In many barrios I think you&#039;ll find very small used bookstores, so it&#039;s probably worth it to spend some time exploring. Also, on loquo.com there seems to be somewhat of a market for used book buyers/sellers: http://madrid.loquo.com/cs/compra-venta/libros-revistas/412

Good luck!</description>

		<description>As someone new to Madrid from the USA, I was hoping to be able to buy lots of Spanish books here to help improve my language.....but I am shocked by the price of paperback books (in Spanish or English). In the USA I&#039;d go to charity shops and used book stores....where do Madrilenos get their books? They can&#039;t welcome paying 20 euros for current fiction books! Surely there is a vibrant used book market for Spanish language books?  Where?</description>
