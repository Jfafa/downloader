		<description>This sounds so cool! I have seen the old station a couple times and wondered what it was. I always figured it was something under construction. I can&#039;t wait to check this out!</description>

		<description>Thanks for this post. I saw a blurb about the opening while--what else?--waiting for the metro. Do you know how much it costs? I can&#039;t seem to find that particular piece of information online.</description>

		<description>A bit OT:

There is a very interesting site about disused parts of the London Underground: http://underground-history.co.uk/

(eg. did you know that the Metropolitan line used to run within 12 miles of Oxford?</description>

		<description>Richard, it is very nice that they have decided to open the station as a museum. 

It was a mysterious station that some of my friends and I used to look for by placing our eyes really near the windows of the train when we were teenagers, but you could only glimpse a couple of details in the dark. Finally earlier this week I saw it completely lit up as I was travelling in line 1 back home.</description>
