		<description>Interesting to see this list. I&#039;m normally biased towards Spain against Portugal but Rosc칩n de Reyes is okay, yet the Portuguese version, Bolo Rei, is fantastic, more like panettone with lots of fruits inside. As for torrijas, I was surprised that this was a special treat for Easter. I had it in El Escorial and it just seemed like egg dipped in bread with sugar on top, I&#039;m afraid to say that I couldn&#039;t finish it. For me Spanish cuisine is wonderful until it&#039;s time for dessert (with the exception of Tarta de Santiago).</description>

		<description>Torrijas are my favourite from all the sweet treats that Julie tell us. You can find two versions, Wine Torrijas or Milk Torrijas, depending in what they&#039;ve been soaking before going into the frying pan.

The bu침uelos are also nice, is little ball of dough filled with different flavours like cream, chocolate, chocolate-truffle, hazelnut...</description>
