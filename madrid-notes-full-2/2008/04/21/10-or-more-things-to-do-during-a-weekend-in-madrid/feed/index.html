		<description>Thank you for the really nice tips!

Many people often stay in the turistic places which is a pity because there are several nice places outside of the city center.

Another tip: try to see a Real Madrid match, this is really great!!! (even if you are not a Real Madrid supporter)</description>

		<description>The changing of the guard ceremony held every Wednesday outside the Royal Palace. Four members of the Royal Guard take part in the ceremony at the Puerta del Príncipe entrance to the Palace. Two foot soldiers will change guard every half hour, and two horseback soldiers once an hour. Each change lasts seven minutes, and will involve 27 guardsmen and six horses throughout the morning until 2 pm. A larger ceremony takes place affair on the first Wednesday of the month - the Relevo Solemne, a 40-minute ceremony involving more than 400 men and 100 horses.</description>

		<description>You could spend half a day discoveing the delights of the Parque Juan Carlos. VERY different from the Retiro, but full of interesting corners of unexpected surprises. Hire a bike; it&#039;s twice the size of the retiro and not level, but well worth the experience.</description>
