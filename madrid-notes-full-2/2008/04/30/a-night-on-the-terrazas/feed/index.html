		<description>These restaurants are indeed really nice!!

It is so nice to walk trough Madrid in the sun and just relax on a terrace.

A restaurant which is very nice and not too expensive is Samá Sama in the city center! I always enjoy the Spanish cuisine in Madrid and this is one of my favorites!</description>

		<description>Get away from those bright city lights. Three stops on the metro from Retiro brings you to Manuel Becerra. Find the back streets around the Jardines De Eva Duarte De Peron and you will have a choice of tiny plazas that seem so removed from the noise and bustle of the city you will think you are in some remote pueblo. Menu del dias from seven and a half euros, no traffic (the streets are too narrow) and a bar owner that seems pleased to have attracted a guiri!
OR, head to Prosperidad. The tourists haven&#039;t a clue where that is. Wonderful tavernas and cafes along the C. de Corazon de Maria, back street bars and the best Chinese restaurant in Madrid.</description>

		<description>Also, in Calle del Castelo (just south of O&#039;Donnell on the map) there are some good Spanish bars such as &quot;La Castela&quot;. They don&#039;t have terrazas along that road unfortunately, but they are genuinely Spanish and also worth trying if you end up in that area after an evening in the Retiro.</description>
