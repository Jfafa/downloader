		<description>Our local community center always has a great schedule of free activities. Everything from Jazz concerts to children&#039;s theater. We&#039;ve found them to be of excellent quality. Watching the children&#039;s theater in Spanish is helping our kids and us with our Spanish comprehension. Just search for &quot;centro cultural&quot; on http://www.munimadrid.es to bring up a list of all the centers. Then look at the ones for your district to see what&#039;s scheduled.

I was also surprised to find that you can hire mountain bikes and take a &quot;train&quot; (it is car made to look like a railway train) ride around Parque Juan Carlos for free!

José Miguel thanks for your suggestion. Does the Relevo Solemne take place once or several times during the first Wednesday of the month? If just once, then please can you tell us at what time?</description>

		<description>Great addition, José Miguel. Perhaps one of these Wednesdays I can get over there see it. I don&#039;t think they had any changing of the guard the last time I visited the Palacio Real a few years ago.</description>

		<description>The changing of the guard ceremony held every Wednesday outside the Royal Palace. Four members of the Royal Guard take part in the ceremony at the Puerta del Príncipe entrance to the Palace. Two foot soldiers will change guard every half hour, and two horseback soldiers once an hour. Each change lasts seven minutes, and will involve 27 guardsmen and six horses throughout the morning until 2 pm. A larger ceremony takes place affair on the first Wednesday of the month - the Relevo Solemne, a 40-minute ceremony involving more than 400 men and 100 horses.</description>
