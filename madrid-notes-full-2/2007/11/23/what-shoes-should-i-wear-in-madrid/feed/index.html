		<description>So given  choice between my New Balance cross trainers and my Eccos, I should wear my Eccos in Madrid? I have Birks but others have warned against that.</description>

		<description>DH Wall, I definitely agree about the band-aids.  For something so small they can be a complete lifesaver.  

And, Marina, these shoes are just the tip of the iceberg, or should I say the stilleto?  I&#039;m mildly obsessed. :)</description>

		<description>A few years ago, I was convinced to try Birkenstock sandals.  I&#039;ve resisted for a long time, but more and more men where I am from are wearing sandals in the summer, so I thought I&#039;d swallow my pride and give them a try.  They take a while to break in, but after that, they are very comfortable.  I was able to wear them in Spain and felt like I fit in because they are German made and sold at a lot of Spain stores.

Whether Birkenstock or other brand, when it comes to sandals for men, I recommend paying a little more for good sandals.  When you are a tourist and walking around all day, you need to do everything possible to avoid blisters.  I do recommend carrying band-aids with you just in case.</description>

		<description>The bottom four pics are for the men.  In terms of a &quot;stylish&quot; athletic shoe, go with one of the brands listed under &quot;sneakers,&quot; and you can&#039;t go wrong.  Basically avoid the white or grey running shoes that you&#039;ll get from Nike, Adidas, Asics, etc.  You shouldn&#039;t look like you belong in the gym (especially since many Spaniards even wear the &quot;stylish&quot; shoes to the gym!).  The modern shape in a dress shoe means a longer body with a slightly narrowed (I&#039;m not going to say pointy but it&#039;s on it&#039;s way) toe.  Avoid the big, round toe.</description>

		<description>A &#039;modern shape&#039; and &#039;stylish&#039; need a bit more explanation &amp; description. I&#039;m a man with limited shoe-fashion knowledge :-)</description>
