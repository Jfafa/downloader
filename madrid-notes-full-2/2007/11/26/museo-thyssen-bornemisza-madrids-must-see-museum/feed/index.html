		<description>Don&#039;t be put off by the most kitsch foyer I&#039;ve ever seen, comprising of a pinkish walls dominated by four giant portraits of Mr and Mrs Thyssen (the latter with a fluffy white cat in the style of 70s Mills and Boon). There are some fantastic medieval works and a limited number of the great masters Holbein, Caravaggio etc. The modern half of the collection is conservative and disappointing, showing up the personal taste of the Thyssens. There is a bias towards muddy realists such as Michael Andrews and Lucien Freud with the welcome relief of a smattering of Pop art. The wife’s side of the collection is full of chocolate box American landscapes but amongst this there are also great finds such as a Casper David Friedrich.</description>

		<description>Good tip Faye. I&#039;m usually not crazy about the museum&#039;s temporary exhibits (I agree they can seem overpriced) but I&#039;m always up for a free foundation-sponsored exhibit.</description>

		<description>The downside of the Thyssen is it doesn&#039;t have a free-entry day like the other sides of the triangle; but it&#039;s definitely the most attractive of the three museums.

The temporary exhibits can be scant and over-priced. Be aware that they usually have a (free) annex in the Fundación Caja Madrid building in Plaza de San Martín (Mº Sol). www.fundacioncajamadrid.es</description>
