		<description>Just made a trip to El Escorial/Valle de los Caidos and wanted to add some transport info. We took the train but the train station is a little over 1 km (slightly uphill) from the monastery and we had to take the local city bus that came once every 30 minutes. It&#039;s possible it could have been more direct to take an interurbano bus from Madrid, no. 661 I believe (from intercambiador de Moncloa station) because the El Escorial bus station is in the heart of San Lorenzo del Escorial (city) and near to the monastery.

Then the best way to get to el Valle de los Caidos via public transport would be to catch the bus that leaves from the El Escorial bus station at 15:15 (no. 660-A). Tickets can be bought starting at 14:45. It returns from Valle de los Caidos at 17:30 and takes you back to El Escorial.</description>

		<description>[...] Madrid is located in the center of Spain. This allows a great deal of ease for great little day trips to outside towns such as Segovia, El Escorial, Aranjuez, and of course Toledo. But, even more it makes traveling to other bigger cities in Spain very doable, Barcelona, Granada, Cordoba and Sevilla are all musts and all within a half day’s travel. [...]</description>

		<description>El Escorial is placed at in a very special location at the foot of the Avantos mount. Also in clear days you can see Madrid from the viewpoint located next to the entrance of the monastery gardens, which are small but nice... and the entrance is free.</description>
