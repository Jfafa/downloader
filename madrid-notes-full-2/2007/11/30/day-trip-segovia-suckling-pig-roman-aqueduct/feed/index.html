		<description>[...] Madrid is located in the center of Spain. This allows a great deal of ease for great little day trips to outside towns such as Segovia, El Escorial, Aranjuez, and of course Toledo. But, even more it makes traveling to other bigger cities in Spain very doable, Barcelona, Granada, Cordoba and Sevilla are all musts and all within a half day’s travel. [...]</description>

		<description>I agree with all of you.  Segovia is by far my favorite day trip out of Madrid.  Maybe it&#039;s the engineer in me that loves the aqueduct.  It&#039;s certainly a nice change of scenery!</description>

		<description>I, as Graeme, also like the real town feeling that Segovia has. 

It is also worth to mention that the aqueduct arches, well all of it really, is made JUST of stone, so the arches stones stay in place only by the pressure of the two stones at either sides. It is also quite impressive that apart from cement they didn&#039;t have cranes in those days, as the stones are really big and the aqueduct is very tall, how they managed is a mystery to me.</description>

		<description>I, too, enjoyed Segovia more than Toledo. I took the bus which was, as I have read, faster than the train. The cathedral was amazing and I enjoyed the relaxing meal in the main plaza in the late afternoon.</description>

		<description>I like Segovia more than Toledo because it has a more &quot;real town&quot; feel to it, not being quite so dependent on tourists. However, I would really recommend against taking the train before the high speed service comes into operation, unless you have plenty of time and a good book to read. I went to Candido once and found it a bit disappointing, although they out on a good show they do as they cut up the cochinillo.</description>
