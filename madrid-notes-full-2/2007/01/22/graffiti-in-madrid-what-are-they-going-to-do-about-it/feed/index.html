		<description>Having just returned from Madrid I found the huge amounts of graffiti depressing..for lots of reasons..

a. virtually none has any artistic merit, reason or purpose

b. It shows a tolerance for mindless desecration of some beautiful things - that people don&#039;t seem too mind..and a real slippery slope.

c. A damming indictment of the youth of madrid that seem to worship at this alter of nihilism - though it is not nihilism, since that has some thought behind it.

I am all for revolution, free expression etc but writing your name on a wall or glass thousands of times just shows that you are just a self obsessed wanker!</description>

		<description>[...] The mindless graffiti and affable goths seem a lukewarm legacy of La Movida Madrileña (the capital&#8217;s post-Franco wild years) which kicked off in Malasaña in the Seventies. However, some of Spain&#8217;s cultural revolutionaries (the ones who didn&#8217;t die of heroine overdoses) are still to be spotted slinking around the barrio, ensuring that the party spirit lives on. Meanwhile, gentrification has led to some great shopping and eating options. [...]</description>

		<description>I know it was before your time Ben - just because you were not in Madrid then. This was about 1985 to maybe even 1995 there was a few left. I bet Marina would know. I will try to post a picture of his work.  Everywhere you went in the city there were big &quot;Muelle&#039;s&quot; and little Muelle&#039;s, always nicely done with different colors.</description>

		<description>I guess Muelle was before my time... I remember a big saw that was sprayed on every hoarding in the north of Madrid, on the way up the A6 and into the sierra, but that seems to have gone now too...</description>

		<description>I hate the grafitti.  Dating myself, I remember when there was none. Only a handfull of &quot;taggers&quot; did graffiti and the best one was &quot;Muelle&quot;.  It actually was art.  Does anybody remember &quot;Muelle&quot;?</description>
