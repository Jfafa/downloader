		<description>Thanks, Sam.  That&#039;s good to know.  And you&#039;re right - the cutoff for purchases is 10pm.  My mistake.  The cash registers at the &quot;reputable&quot; stores simply will not accept an alcohol purchase after that time!</description>

		<description>Technically, in Spain and indeed in many other European countries, its actually illegal to go around the streets without a form of identification, so you may have more the bouncers to worry about! (Although I&#039;m sure its very unlikely you&#039;d get stopped by any Guardia Civil.)

Personally, I always carry my driving license with me, not least so I can use my Credit Card, and especially now that the &quot;Tarjeta de Residencia&quot; is near impossible to get hold of! In England, and indeed it seems the US, the laws are for more libertarian and there is no requirement to become a number like in Spain!

Additionally, its actually impossible to buy Alcohol after 10pm in shops in Spain, not midnight unless there is some special license I don&#039;t know of. However, its well known that many of the &quot;chinos&quot;, the corner-shop equivalents, will be more than happy to sell you anything at any time, and probably to anyone!

Cheers, sam</description>

		<description>I agree--better safe than sorry. Funnily enough, the only time I was ever carded here was during my first week living in Madrid, two years ago, in a bar in Malasaña. For whatever (stupid) reason I wasn&#039;t carrying ID and we had to leave. But we were promptly let in to a better bar just down the street ;).</description>
