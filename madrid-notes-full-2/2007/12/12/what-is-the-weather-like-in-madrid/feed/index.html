		<description>I was pretty happy with Madrid weather during a November visit.  No jacket was required.  Only a sweater.  Sometimes it is colder though.</description>

		<description>Like one colour of paint when it runs into another.

As for April, that&#039;s a tricky one. This year I sunbathed in the Casa de Campo. But looking at my electricity bill, I can see I also had the heating on. The chart linked to above suggests between 6ยบ and 16ยบ is normal.

Btw, the most accurate weather site is (appropriately enough) accuweather.com, I find. You can get a forecast for up to two weeks.</description>

		<description>Katie&#039;s right: the distance from the sea makes a big difference in humidity. There&#039;s a handy graph here: http://www.spanish-fiestas.com/madrid/weather.htm.</description>

		<description>As a former resident of New York, I can vouch for the fact that the cold in Madrid doesn&#039;t approximate the cold in New York, though people here complain like it does. The main characteristic of the weather in Madrid for me is dryness. It&#039;s unlike anything I&#039;ve ever experienced before--New York is quite humid. The sun, I swear, is also hotter here than in the States, even in winter.</description>
