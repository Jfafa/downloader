		<description>@ Julie - yes it is the one we had a good lunch there last time in Madrid. 

@Ben - I knew that.... ;-)

@ Janice, yes the articles are excellent and well written and worthwhile and will come in really handy when I take my son and his girlfriend to MAD. We struggle when she goes out for a meal with us - here is too little consideration given to vegetarians in English restaurants and I can imagine that Spain is worse.</description>

		<description>@Gary--I wanted to point you to an earlier NFM review of Taberna del Almendro (of meaty rosca fame) at http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/2007/02/01/taberna-del-almendro-from-michael-carlin/. Is that the one you were referring to?</description>

		<description>@Gary - we&#039;ll do a carnivores series too!

@Janice - you have to try El Granero on Calle Argumosa in Lavapies - we&#039;ll do a full review soon, it&#039;s really wonderful.</description>

		<description>I am a long time vegetarian. I spent two weeks in Madrid this past July and survived although I did have to repeatedly tell the waiter, no, no como mariscos o pescado.
 Thank you for the articles for us vegetarians (a small but growing minority).  Most of the sites which review restaurants in Madrid are only geared toward carnivores (omnivores).  I will be returning to Madrid again this summer (can&#039;t wait) and will try Yerbabuena.  I wanted to go there this summer but ran out of time.  
I did eat a few times at Fresco, Maoz and a few places off the standard tourist track and found a lot of good food sin carne.
Thank you again.  Keep up the good work.</description>

		<description>The last three excellent articles posted by Julie Katie and Amy have left me in no doubt that I can eat well as a vegetarian in Madrid. 

On behalf of us carnivores and omnivores (most of the world) is there any chance of reviewing places that serve the kind of delicious dishes that are not so good for us?

Hylogui or Tabena Almendro anyone?</description>
