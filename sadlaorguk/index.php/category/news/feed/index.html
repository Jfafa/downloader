			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Letting Agents Right of Redress Scheme comes into effect on 1<br />
October 2014, by which time letting agents will have had to register<br />
with 1 of 3 redress schemes, to ensure tenants and leaseholders have a<br />
straightforward option to hold their agents to account. Anyone who feels<br />
they get a poor deal from their letting agent will then be able to take<br />
their complaint to the redress scheme, and could receive compensation.<br />
The schemes are run by The Property Ombudsman, Ombudsman Services<br />
Property and the Property Redress Scheme.</p>

<p>The Council are disappointed that there have only been 4 applications for the voluntary scheme so far. A voluntary scheme was suggested by landlords<br />
as an alternative to Selective Licensing so are hopeful that landlords would show their support of it<br />
Now that Selective Licensing processes are up and running, they are starting to work in the Voluntary area<br />
They are also keeping a close eye on neighbouring areas such as Darnall, Tinsley, Wincobank and Grimesthorpe to assess whether<br />
they are experiencing similar issues in the private rented sector.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Council have presented two reports to the cabinet on 15th January detailing two schemes they will be introducing to the Page Hall Area:</p>
<p>The voluntary registration scheme area includes around 520 private rented properties.

the Council more teeth to tackle the irresponsible management of private rental properties, which is contributing to the issues in Page Hall. The scheme would include support for landlords and tenants.<br />
The overall aims of the proposal are to:</p>
<p><strong>Improve the standard of private rented housing</strong>.  Increases in standards will result directly from enforcement action taken on specific properties, and landlords proactively improving their properties and tenancy management tocomply with the new scheme</p>
<p><strong>Break the cycle of low demand</strong>, which sees house prices fall as the area is considered less desirable, established residents selling-up (or dealing with the stress of falling / negative equity), more houses being let irresponsibly, making the area less desirable, and so the cycle repeats</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sheffield council have taken a Sheffield Landlord to court, Michelle Slater from Sheffield council gave details of their work in the following email:</p>
<p>&#8220;I would like to draw your attention to another prosecution case.</p>
<p>We took court action against Mr Das last year which resulted in a suspended<br />
prison sentence.  We then took out another case which meant he was in<br />
breach of his suspended sentence.</p>
<p>Our case was adjourned twice, and in the meantime he was taken to court for<br />
benefits fraud.</p>
<p>Our offences were heard yesterday and we also received a custodial<br />
sentence.  This is the second landlord we have sent to prison.</p>
<p>There is a link below and we are expecting further press for the housing<br />
offences.  Please do share this with your colleagues.</p>
<p>Kind regards<br />
Michelle&#8221;<br />
